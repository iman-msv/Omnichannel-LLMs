1,My husband thought he was going to surprise me with an Apple Watch because I’ve only had Fitbits and have not liked the one I got last year.  He saw this item as a Black Friday deal and ordered it and we couldn’t believe it was delivered first thing this morning and was less than 24 hours from ordering.  My extreme frustration comes because I can’t charge it!!!!!  I read reviews on all types of products and went back to the reviews about how to charge the watch so I can at least set it up.  I actually had to type in and search for charger questions to find out what I needed.  The charging cord is included but it doesn’t have the adapter that the cord plugs into that goes into the wall.  To make it more frustrating it isn’t the standard usb adapter most households have tons of but needs a specific usb-c which I’ve never even seen before.  Why in the world is it not pointed out that you cannot charge the watch without this piece?  Am I the only person that would not have searched out this specific issue before buying the watch????,Very disappointed and haven’t even set up the watch yet,1.0,"['Color: Silver Aluminum Case with Storm Blue Sport Band', 'Size: 40mm', 'Style: S/M - fits 130–180mm wrists', 'Configuration: Without AppleCare+']",2023-11-25
2,"This product isn’t worth it, I had this watch for a little over a month. I have a small wrist and bought the smaller version purposely. Well no matter what I did, picking up my 1 year old for example or shoving my hand in my pocket this watch would pop off my wrist even tho it wasn’t overnight or too loose. Well today in a store I picked up my toddler and bam it falls on the ground and breaks. I went to see if anything is covered under warranty and Amazon and Apple both said it’s not covered and if I want it fixed I need to pay another 200 dollars to get it repaid. Sad you pay a decent amount of money for these things and neither company will help you out. I should’ve stuck with the Fitbit or any other smart watch instead that was more durability and had an ACTUAL warranty that was focused on decent customer service.",Don’t waste your money,1.0,"['Color: Starlight Aluminum Case with Starlight Sport Band', 'Size: 40mm', 'Style: S/M - fits 130–180mm wrists', 'Configuration: Without AppleCare+']",2023-11-27

What I really like is the lightweight nature of it. It was a night and day difference when I switched watches. I don’t even feel it on my wrist most of the time, which allows me to sleep with it comfortably, which I never did before with the fossil watch. So it’s nice that I now get to experience the benefits of sleep tracking. I like that the wake feature always works, which has not been my experience in the past.

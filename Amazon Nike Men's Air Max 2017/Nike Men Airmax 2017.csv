"The shoe is comfortable but after wearing for 6 months the tread of the shoe is completely gone and the air pockets are sticking out of the bottom of the shoe.

"The shoes feel and look nice. Unfortunately the quality of the sole does not live up to expectations. After years of using ASICS, I bought my first Nike again, and am thoroughly disappointed. After running only 60 miles or so, the one heal is through, and the other almost. Sadly I only noticed after the 30 day return window was passed. BTW, if you order from Nike, you will get a 60 day return window. Fail on Nike for the poor quality, and fail on Amazon for not offering the same return policy as Nike.",Not for running!,1,10/19/22,13,Black/White/Anthracite
"I understand these aren‚Äôt brand new 2022 air maxes- but when I spent $280 on these shoes I expect them to be perfect and last awhile. The sole of the shoe ‚Äúpopped‚Äù 2 weeks after buying them. It must have been a seem. The seller told me to take them to a Nike store because they would be under warranty- wel let me tel you if you purchase from a 3rd party company- they do not honor the warranty because they weren‚Äôt purchased directly through Nike- even though we‚Äôre paying the same amount. Save yourself the TIME and MONEY, but from a Nike Store. NOTE: the seller finally accepted a refund- just ridiculous though!",Product was defective,1,4/8/22,9,Black/White/Anthracite

These shoes are supposed to be some of the best.  I bought them.  Expensive.  Barely used them.  Except for working out in the gym.  And my left air pocket popped and I almost sprained my ankle.  Tried contacting this company and they havent responded. Amazon will not do anything for me. They told me to go to the manufacturer to take advantage of the warranty.  But Nike won't honor the air pocket lifetime warranty. I'm pretty discouraged by all 3 companies right now.  Not one will do anything. Don't buy these shoes.,Defective shoes.  Amazon won't back the company either that theyve allowed on their site,1,9/7/20,9,Black/White/Anthracite

So I've essentially wore the shoes for 2 months and the air pocket on them had a leak so I literally had a flat tire.  These are the most comfortable shoes ever until you get a flat tire.

"The Nike Air Max 2017 Men's Running Shoes are a great option for people looking for comfortable and stylish shoes. The shoes feature a sleek and modern design, with a breathable mesh upper that allows for maximum airflow and keeps feet cool and dry. While it's coined a ""running shoe"", I don't think this would be a great shoe for serious runners. To me, it's better labeled a ""casual shoe"". Two reasons for this:",A great casual shoe,4,1/18/23,10,Cool Grey/Anthracite-dark Grey
"i am 47 and a life long Nike wearer.  While i like the look and feel of these shoes as i would expect from my previous years of experience with Nike, they are very squeaky.  The fit is perfect but the slight movement of my feet within the shoe causes them to squeak.  I thought this would go away once i had them broke in but i worn them for 5-6 days a week at work and play for a couple months but the squeak continues.  I am going to have to give up on being sneaky any time i wear these.",super squeaky shoes,4,6/28/23,10,Cool Grey/Anthracite-dark Grey

"I ordered all black and got a gray Nike symbol instead. Other than that, so far they seem legit. I really don't have a complaint at the moment, they seem to have no holes in the air pockets and they aren't falling apart like some said. Perhaps a bit of time worn will change my opinion, but I looked them over scrupulously after seeing more reviews. No complaints on my end other than the color.","Not exactly what I ordered, but I'm not terribly disappointed.",4,7/27/22,9,Black/Black/Black

"I‚Äôve been wearing Nike for some time and have loved the lighter weight flyknit shoes. I had a pair similar to these and wanted something that might hold up to winter weather better.

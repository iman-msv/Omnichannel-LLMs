<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>In this paper, the authors review current literature on retail formats and propose a new customer-centric framework for retailers to focus on as they continue to innovate and evolve. Specifically, they review the literature on how formats compare in their attributes and compete with each other; the role of customer behavior in format choice; and developments in multichannel and omnichannel retailing. They propose a framework for retail formats suggesting two paths – either reduce friction in the customer journey or enhance customer experience. They discuss the challenges faced by offline (physical store-first) and online (digital-first) retailers and elaborate on strategies each type of retailer is pursuing to address these challenges. Finally, they offer directions for future research in this domain. They conclude by calling for newer digital-first and physical-first players to continue coming up with different customer-centric formats, which they predict will slowly morph into integrated retailers, leaving space for newer players to enter the market and hence keep the wheel of retailing spinning.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="role-of-consumer-behavior-in-retail-format-choice">Role of consumer behavior in retail format choice</h3>
<p>Consumers seek to choose a format and price level that best suits their needs in a given shopping situation. Because a retailer can survive only if it can profit from providing a given mix of services, consumers ultimately determine the market formats. Therefore, it is essential to examine the services required by consumers as they proceed through the customer journey.</p>
<p>The first two stages are the basic stages of the purchase process, i.e., information search and purchase. Since goods sold online are acquired only after delivery, we consider acquisition as a third separate stage of the customer journey. Since product return is a particularly important factor for online sellers, it is considered a separate and last stage of the journey.</p>
</section>
<section id="information-search" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="information-search">Information search</h3>
<p>Concerning search, Ehrlich and Fisher (1982) presented and tested a model in which consumers value advertising because it lowers their search costs. In return, they pay a higher margin that covers the cost of advertising.</p>
<p>As consumers do not need to travel to online stores, their online search costs should be relatively low. All three studies found that although search costs were low, consumers still did not search extensively. The finding of limited search is also characteristic of offline shopping and needs explanation.</p>
<p>Though conditions under which sales assistance can be useful have been conceptually outlined (Wernerfelt, 1994b), detailed empirical evidence about salespeople’s role in in-store search is scarce.</p>
<p>Customers may search offline and buy online, a practice labeled showrooming (Ailawadi &amp; Farris, 2017). Since showrooming leads retailers to provide information to consumers without being compensated for their efforts such as salesperson time, showrooming is a problem for offline retailers and has received considerable attention.</p>
<p>Buying at the store rather than showrooming is more likely when online search costs are perceived to be high, in-store sales personnel are more accessible, and consumers are under time pressure.</p>
<p>Since manufacturers benefit if consumers receive pre-sales services from offline retailers, they could alleviate the showrooming problem by compensating retailers for providing the appropriate level of service.</p>
</section>
<section id="purchase" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="purchase">Purchase</h3>
<p>Accessibility is a major differentiating factor for offline retailers. Consequently, there is an extensive literature on the trade-off between the attractiveness of the store (or overall trade area) and the consumer’s distance from the store.</p>
<p>They found that the reduction in shopping trips, resulting from one-stop shopping at supermarkets, and facilitated by their broad assortment, justified this format’s choice by consumers.</p>
<p>Studies on consumer preferences provide insights potentially relevant to practice. In a study of grocery shopping behavior, Bell, Ho, and Tang (1998) found that large-basket shoppers prefer everyday low pricing (EDLP).</p>
<p>There are some segmentation studies of shoppers. Ganesh, Reynolds, Luckett, and Pomirleanu (2010) found that online shopper segments were similar to offline shopper segments derived in other studies. Konus, Verhoef, and Neslin (2008) used latent class analysis of self-reported information-seeking and purchase behavior to form three clusters of shoppers: uninvolved (40%), multichannel (37%), and store-focused (23%). Psychographic and demographic variables were used as covariates. Multichannel shoppers were found to be the highest of the three clusters in innovativeness and shopping enjoyment, while store-focused shoppers were found to be highest in loyalty.</p>
</section>
<section id="acquisition" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="acquisition">Acquisition</h3>
<p>For online channels, acquisition (i.e., getting the product in one’s hands) generally occurs after purchase and involves a consumer decision about the cost and timing of delivery. Purchase and acquisition are also commonly separated in many offline channels (for example, furniture and major appliances). The separation of purchase and acquisition leads sellers to compete on shipping fees and delivery time.</p>
<p>Shipping fees provide an opportunity to engage in price discrimination, and in practice, many different fee structures abound. There have been many different studies of the economics of shipping fee structures.</p>
</section>
<section id="returns" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="returns">Returns</h3>
<p>Returns lower the risk of buying online without personal inspection; thus, return policies are particularly important for online retailers. However, Banjo (2013) reports that around onethird of all online purchases are returned, creating operational challenges for retailers and affecting profitability. With more and more retailers serving customers through both online and offline channels, efficiently managing product returns across channels should be a key strategic focus.</p>
<p>Their results indicate that free shipping encourages the purchase of more risky products, leading to increased returns. Some other noteworthy findings in the literature are that a product’s performance in a channel and its return rate are inversely related (Dzyabura, Siham, Hauser, &amp; Ibragimov, 2019); availability of more product reviews, lower dispersion in ratings, and the presence of more helpful reviews all lead to fewer product returns (Sahoo, Dellarocas, &amp; Srinivasan, 2018); and return rates for online purchases decrease after store openings (Wang &amp; Goldfarb, 2017).</p>

<section id="competition-between-offline-retail-formats" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="competition-between-offline-retail-formats">Competition between offline retail formats</h4>
<p>Basker (2007), who mainly summarizes her studies of Walmart, attributes its success to the interaction of superior technology and economies of scale, both of which give the retailer a cost advantage allowing for lower prices.</p>
<p>However, Zhu, Singh, and Dukes (2011) also demonstrated that an existing retailer could benefit if a mass merchandiser (e.g., Walmart) establishes a location nearby. The existing retailer can benefit if it sells unique items not sold by the mass merchandiser. The existing retailer loses on those items also sold by Walmart but benefits from the spillover effect of Walmart’s presence on the sales of its unique items.</p>
<p>The magnitude of switching costs uncovered in this study may help explain why Ellickson and Misra (2007) found that competing firms tended to choose the same strategy in a given market, rather than differentiating themselves. Gauri et al.&nbsp;(2008) also found that competing stores tend to differentiate on either pricing or format strategy.</p>
</section>
<section id="competition-between-offline-and-online-retail-formats" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="competition-between-offline-and-online-retail-formats">Competition between offline and online retail formats</h4>
<p>Using marketlevel data from 1994 to 2003, Goldmanis, Hortacsu, Syverson, and Emre (2010) showed that the large decline in the number of small offline establishments in the travel, book, and automobile industries was associated with increased internet usage in a given market. This is consistent with their model, in which the arrival of the internet had a significant impact on the structure of these markets by reducing search costs.</p>
<p>Since there is no need to invest in physical stores, and no need to maintain an inventory in each store, online retailing can achieve considerable economies of scale on the supply side. Centralized distribution centers and drop shipping arrangements with suppliers allow online sellers to have very large assortments.</p>
<p>Due to savings in inventory costs, online retailing has a big advantage in selling less popular items (the long tail) and in removing geographic barriers to purchase.</p>
<p>As noted above, online sellers have an advantage in facilitating a search for information on digital attributes (including price). In contrast, offline sellers have an advantage in providing information on non-digital attributes and providing faster delivery. This leads to the possibility that consumers will search among both online and offline retailers.</p>
</section>
<section id="multichannel-and-omnichannel-retailing" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="multichannel-and-omnichannel-retailing">Multichannel and omnichannel retailing</h4>
<p>Multichannel refers to the design, deployment, coordination, and evaluation of different channels through which the marketer acquires, develops, and retains customers (Neslin et al., 2006), while omnichannel refers to integrating activities within and across channels.</p>
<p>Since online retailing has advantages in accessibility an assortment, while offline retailing has advantages in personal inspection and immediate delivery, retailers can combine the two channels to offer all types of services.</p>
<p>The effect of offline retailers adding an online channel is more nuanced. In a U.S. supermarket chain study, Pozzi (2013) found that adding an online channel increased overall revenues by 13 percent. This was mainly due to reduced travel costs. Conversely, Melis, Campo, Breugelmans, and Lamey (2015) found that grocery customers tended to be loyal to the online outlet of their favorite offline chain initially, but then shopped among all online sellers after they gained more experience buying groceries online. The implication is that online outlets need to be competitive with the online outlets of other chains.</p>
<p>There is considerable evidence that consistency between offline and online offerings is beneficial. Badrinarayanan, Becerra, and Kim (2012) found that trust in the offline channel, and congruence between the offline and online channels, were positively associated with trust and purchase intention for the online channel.</p>
<p>Hammerschmidt, Falk, and Wieters (2016) found that online and offline channels should be alignable; in other words, consistent in their attributes. Emrich and Verhoef (2015) found that a homogeneous web design (consistent with the design of the offline store) had the largest effect on patronage intentions.</p>
<p>For a retailer with both offline and online outlets, the internet and well-conceived customer databases allow tracking consumers through many stages of the purchase process. This has led to the idea of omnichannel marketing and the development of marketing strategies for each stage in the purchase process (Verhoef, Kannan, &amp; Inman, 2015). Consumers might encounter information about a retailer through search and display advertisements, retailer stores, referral websites, a retailer’s website, or desktop and mobile devices—and each may merit its own channel strategy.</p>

<section id="customer-centric-retail-formats" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="customer-centric-retail-formats">Customer-centric retail formats</h3>
<p>We recognize that quality and price considerations alone are no longer sufficient when customers decide between multiple formats. However, because quality and price are key characteristics of a retailer’s offering, they are still critical aspects of a retail format.</p>
<p>Yet quality and price are no longer enough. Consumers now engage with retailers using digital and mobile devices, which has fundamentally changed the customer journey. Gone are the days when the manufacturer unilaterally controlled brand communications, modeling the customer journey as a simple purchase funnel. Now, marketers map the customer journey to identify points of friction and opportunities to enhance the customer experience. We propose that the retailer take one of these two paths—either (1) reduce friction in the consumer’s shopping process or (2) enhance the shopping experience. Observe that the first path takes away obstacles and impediments by shortening wait times, reducing inconveniences, and eliminating unnecessary steps in the journey. The second path creates pleasurable experiences based on customers’ preferences and behaviors.</p>
<p>In summary, we propose that a customer-centric retail format should go beyond price and quality to either add value to or remove impediments from the shopping experience. Our framework encompasses many conceptual models that have been proposed in the literature to understand the consumer journey in retailing and the role of technology in it.</p>
<p>Their other dimension of social presence deals with how technology can make individuals feel as if they are interacting with others, and therefore corresponds to enhancing customer experience in our framework.</p>
</section>
<section id="evolution-of-retail-formats" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evolution-of-retail-formats">Evolution of retail formats</h3>
<p>We delineate the customer journey into two parts – first, information search and purchase, and second, product acquisition and potential product return. We differentiate between purchase and product acquisition, as customers cannot immediately obtain their purchases in all formats. Information search and purchase primarily (though not exclusively) provide opportunities to enhance experience, whereas product acquisition and product return primarily (again, not exclusively) provide opportunities for reducing friction. We also consider challenges that offline and online formats face during this two-stage customer journey.</p>
<section id="offline-retailers-challenges" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="offline-retailers-challenges">Offline retailers: challenges</h4>
<p>This comfort with online shopping has leapfrogged by several timespans during the pandemic. Some of the pandemicinduced changes in consumer behavior are likely to persist.</p>
<p>Online sales did not incur sales tax for a long time, which reduced the final price for consumers. Furthermore, because online retailers do not incur the expense of maintaining stores and holding inventory at multiple stores, their overall cost structure can be lower.</p>
<p>The resulting fall in foot traffic further increased offline retailers’ cost disadvantage and reduced their cost-efficiency. Another critical challenge for offline retailers is rising customer expectations regarding purchase convenience and purchase experience.</p>
<p>There is considerable friction (inconvenience) for the customer in getting to the store, finding parking, navigating the store, being surrounded by others, especially in the current pandemic, waiting to pay, and if required, going back to return the product.</p>
<p>Moreover, offline retailers find it challenging to offer the breadth and depth of assortment available through online channels. Differentiating themselves from online channels by imparting experiential aspects of purchase raises its own challenges. Improving experiential aspects of shopping and reducing friction in the purchase process require investments in, for example, technology, which further adds to the costs of offline retailers.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="online-retailers-challenges" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="online-retailers-challenges">Online retailers: challenges</h3>
<p>Online retailers needed to provide consumers with a reason to change their traditional purchase behavior. The most effective tool for this purpose has been the product variety and assortment that online retailers can offer. Compared to offline retailers, online retailers can afford to maintain huge inventories in a few limited locations and ship anywhere from there. Additionally, they can offer lower prices, which has helped their rapid growth.</p>
<p>One of the key challenges online retailers face relates to product delivery. Consumers do not get the instant gratification of acquiring their purchase, which encourages some to choose offline channels instead.</p>
<p>Online stores are also at a disadvantage when sensory information or ambience is vital for customers to experience or interact with the product – e.g., in apparel – or when the freshness of the product is critical – e.g., in grocery and produce. The fact that the entire transaction is conducted online also raises trust issues for some consumers who like to inspect or validate product quality before purchase. Furthermore, reverse logistics pose both financial and operational challenges for online retailers.</p>

<h1>Omni-channel management in the new retailing era: A systematic review and future research agenda <span class="citation" data-cites="Cai_2020">(<a href="#ref-Cai_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Cai and Lo 2020</a>)</span></h1>
<section id="abstract-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-1">Abstract</h2>
<p>Omni-channel retailing is a popular strategy in a new retailing era when digitalization, social media, big data and other emerging technologies (e.g., Artificial Intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), blockchain, etc.) are transforming the retail business models. Meanwhile, omni-channel related operations impose a challenge on either well-established firms or new setups that they have to make “right” decisions to fit in the new retail environment. This review paper endeavors to reveal the established knowledge behind the omni-channel retailing literature, generate managerial implications for firms, and provides a guideline for future research. We conduct this systematic review by adopting citation network analysis (CNA). The CNA helps identify seven independent and interdependent research domains, which depict (or constitute) a whole picture of “omnichannel management”. The main path analysis reveals that each identified research domain is under study. We also find that the extant literature seldom examines the roles of how new technologies play in the “omnichannel management”. Moreover, the domain of supply chain management and inventory management in the omnichannel environment is absent in this systematic literature review. Therefore, we propose a prescribed framework for “omnichannel management” (PFOM), which contributes to the literature on “omnichannel management” and provides important managerial applications to the retail firms that plan to implement the omnichannel strategy.</p>
</section>
<section id="brief-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="brief-1">Brief</h2>
<p>Verhoef et al.&nbsp;(2015) formally define “omnichannel management” as “the synergetic management of the numerous available channels and customer touchpoints, in such a way that the customer experience across channels and the performance over channels are optimized.” However, “multiple channel retailing management” is to provide products or services to the consumers across multiple channels (i.e., online, offline, etc.), but it does not provide synergetic management of the numerous available channels. And “cross channel retailing management” provides partial integration among the channels. The definitions show the big difference among “omnichannel management”, “multiple channel retailing management”, and “cross channel retailing management”.</p>
<p>We can see that omni-channel retailing is very popular nowadays in the new retailing era when digitalization, social media, big data and other new technologies (e.g., AI, VR, blockchain, etc.) are transforming the retail business models.</p>
<p>Thus, omni-channel related operations impose a challenge to either well-established firms or new setups that they have to make “right” decisions to fit in the new retailing environment.</p>
<p>The top three research areas (based on Web of Science) are Business Economics, Operations Research Management Science, and Computer Science. The top 10 journals publishing omnichannel management related papers are the journals featured by retailing, marketing, management science, etc.</p>
<p>Citation Network Analysis helps identify 7 research domains and the 7 clusters are both independent and interdependent, which depict a whole picture of “omnichannel management”. 7 research domains are omnichannel strategy, omnichannel retailing, omnichannel customer service, omnichannel logistics and fulfilment, omnichannel marketing and advertisement, omnichannel consumer behaviors, and omnichannel customers’ preferences, the top three among which are omnichannel strategy, omnichannel retailing and omnichannel customer service.</p>
<p>OM research in an omni-channel environment and its related areas are not yet wellestablished. We finally identify the keywords as follows: omni-channel (omnichannel, cross channel) retailing, omni-channel (omnichannel, cross channel) marketing, omnichannel (omnichannel, cross channel) strategy, omni-channel (omnichannel, cross channel) logistics and distribution, omni-channel (omnichannel, cross channel) supply chain management, omnichannel (omnichannel, cross channel) customer experience, O2O, click &amp; collect, and buy-online-and-pickup-in-store.</p>
<p>In the omnichannel environment, the product or service can be delivered to the end consumers through a series of activities like retailing, marketing, customer service, etc., and a variety of channels like online channel, offline store, video and TV channels, etc.</p>
<p>The “omnichannel strategy” is positioned as the strategic level, while the others are located at the operational level.</p>
<section id="omnichannel-strategy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="omnichannel-strategy">Omnichannel Strategy</h3>
<p>Zhang et al.&nbsp;(2010) is the early work exploring the integration and synergies of multichannel retailing, which facilitates the development of this research domain omnichannel strategy. The authors identify opportunities for managing multiple channels’ synergies which emphasize the importance of cross-channel operations, like cross-channel prices and promotions, customer communication, marketing research, etc.</p>
<p>Cao and Li (2015) examine the impact of cross-channel integration on sales and reveal that the cross-channel integration strategy can boost the retailers’ sales growth.</p>
<p>Picot-Coupey et al.&nbsp;(2016) find that it is difficult for retailers to directly shift from multi-channel retailing to omni-channel retailing, because the retailers have to face the strategy-related challenges at the first stage in the transformative process. The authors suggest organizational learning and trial-and-error learning in the channel design for successfully implementing the omni-channel retailing strategy. Recently, Shen et al.&nbsp;(2018) examine the influential factors for omnichannel service usage and identify that the quality of channel integration significantly affects the users’ experience across all the channels. The authors suggest that the practitioners should pay attention to the service transparency, channel choice variety and content and process consistency.</p>
<p>Kazancoglu and Aydin (2018) investigate consumers’ purchasing intentions on omni-channel buying and generate important factors as follows: trust, situation, risk, anxiety, interaction need, and privacy. The authors suggest the retailers incorporate these factors into the omni-channel retailing from the consumers’ perspective.</p>
<p>Based on the above analysis, we can see omni-channel strategy plays an essential role in omni-channel management. However, not every company can benefit from this strategy, due to the complexity of this retailing model. We suggest each firm should initiate a customized omnichannel strategy, because each firm may possess different channel resources and assets. For future research, we propose three perspectives: i) How to improve the omni-channel efficiency from the organization behaviors perspective; ii) How to re-visit the value chain in the omnichannel context; iii) How to gain the competitive advantage in the omni-channel retailing era (Picot-Coupey et al., 2016).</p>
</section>
<section id="omnichannel-retailing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="omnichannel-retailing">Omnichannel retailing</h3>
<p>Omnichannel retailing aims at integrating all the channels and optimizes the retailer’s total sales.</p>
<p>Brynjolfsson et al.&nbsp;(2013) identify that technology plays a crucial role in omnichannel retailing and suggests that the retailers and their supply chain partners should reshape their competitive advantages. The authors propose possible successful strategies for omnichannel retailers, like attractive pricing strategy, powerful data analytics ability, unique product provider, etc. Bell et al.&nbsp;(2014) demonstrate a customer-focused framework for omnichannel retailing model in which the information and products delivered to consumers are most important.</p>
<p>Next, Gao and Su (2017a) study how to deliver both online and offline information to omnichannel consumers effectively.</p>
<p>Zhang et al.&nbsp;(2018a) study consumer returns and order cancellation in the omnichannel context and conclude that the retailers cannot always benefit from the omnichannel strategy because the value of omnichannel retailing is subject to many factors, like “cross-selling benefit and the market expansion effect”.</p>
<p>For future research, we propose the following directions: i) More channels’ interaction and integration should be explored (for example, the interaction between social media retailing and brick-and-mortar retailing); ii) How do new technologies (e.g., VR, AI, Blockchain, etc.) transform the omnichannel retailing? iii) Manage risks associated with the omnichannel retailing (Brynjolfsson et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2018b).</p>

<p>From Falk et al.&nbsp;(2007) and Kwon and Lennon (2009), we learn that cross-channel effects are different in different contexts and their correlation can be both positively and negatively related.</p>
<p>For future research, we suggest more attention should be paid to i) How to help the consumers to achieve the seamless omnichannel experience; ii) How to increase the consumers’ “channel loyalty” through channel service quality enhancement; iii) How to design the service quality standards in a “smart city” (Burnes and Towers, 2016; Yang et al., 2013).</p>
</section>
<section id="omnichannel-logistics-and-fulfilment" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="omnichannel-logistics-and-fulfilment">Omnichannel logistics and fulfilment</h3>
<p>De Kervenoael et al.&nbsp;(2015) study the logistics service of online grocery retail and find that the flexibility of collection points, offline infrastructure service and premium provision are significant aspects for improving consumers’ expectations.</p>
<p>Hübner et al.&nbsp;(2016) investigate the retail fulfillment in the integrated omni-channel environment and analyze the logistics options for integrated fulfillment. The authors suggest that retailers, who operate in multiple channels should design their warehouse system for channel-integrated inventory management.</p>
<p>The authors suggest that omni-channel retailers should consider the specifics of the country, the retailer and the customer behaviors into the omni-channel logistics design.</p>
<p>Marchet et al.&nbsp;(2018) identify 11 logistics variables in the omni-channel management strategy in four aspects: delivery, distribution, fulfilment and returns management. The authors indicate that a “one-fits-all” business logistics model is absent.</p>
<p>Melacini et al.&nbsp;(2018) conduct a systematic literature review on e-fulfilment and distribution in omni-channel retailing and investigate the issues of distribution network, delivery, and inventory management. The authors identify that many essential topics in the omnichannel context are underexplored, which includes “retail distribution networks, assortment planning over multiple channels, the logistics role played by stores in the delivery process, and the interplay between different logistics aspects.” Galipoglu et al.&nbsp;(2018) overview the omni-channel retailing relevant literature and focus on logistics and supply chain management research domain. The authors reveal that the consideration of logistics and supply chain management literature is limited in the omni-channel retailing context. Moreover, the authors call for more attention on the conceptual and analytical research.</p>
<p>Kembro et al.&nbsp;(2018) conduct a structured literature review on warehouse operations and design in omni-channel logistics. The authors find that less attention is paid to the domain of warehouse operations and design. Instead, more discussions are given to consumer demand changes and network design. The authors identify ten themes from the extant literature for omni-channel warehousing and generate a comprehensive and structured agenda for future research by taking into account the network design, channel management, and value proposition.</p>
<p>Lim and Srai (2018) investigate how the interaction between of last-mile supply networks and the underlying mechanisms affect the omnichannel performance. The authors suggest managers consider product types and delivery responsiveness, when designing an appropriate last-mile supply network. Afterwards, Lim and Winkenbach (2018) study how retailers execute the last-mile delivery to meet the omnichannel demand and establish a typology of last-mile distribution by incorporating the product variety and delivery responsiveness.</p>
</section>
<section id="omnichannel-marketing-and-advertisement" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="omnichannel-marketing-and-advertisement">Omnichannel marketing and advertisement</h3>
<p>Ghose and Yang (2009) study the sponsored search method in the search engine advertising. Dinner et al.&nbsp;(2014) examine cross-channel effects of traditional media and online advertising on offline and online sales. The authors find that paid search advertising is more effective than traditional advertising on driving offline sales.</p>
<p>Hilken et al.&nbsp;(2018) explore how the new technology augmented reality (AR) improve customers’ omnichannel experiences. The authors find that seamless omnichannel experiences can be acquired through AR and the current obstacles existing in the omnichannel environment can be smoothed.</p>
<p>This main path has shown the essential issues of the omnichannel marketing and advertisement, which includes the effectiveness of search engine advertising, marketing resources allocation, cross-channel effects, the transformation brought by new technologies, etc. However, the current research for this area is insufficient. For future research, we outline three aspects: i) What is integrated marketing strategy for omnichannel retailing? ii) How to manage risks in social media marketing? iii) More analytical modeling research for the optimal online and offline marketing investment are needed (Kannan and Li, 2017; Verhoef et al., 2017).</p>
</section>
<section id="omnichannel-consumer-behaviors" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="omnichannel-consumer-behaviors">Omnichannel consumer behaviors</h3>
<p>Chiu et al.&nbsp;(2011) study consumers’ free-riding behaviors in cross-channel purchasing, in which consumers can obtain the product information from one channel and shop in another channel.</p>
<p>Pantano and Viassone (2015) study how to effectively engage consumers in the integrated multichannel retailing and find that if the retailer can provide the consumers with the integrated retailing environment, consumers’ switching purchasing from competitors’ channels can be avoided.</p>
<p>Later on, Li et al.&nbsp;(2018a) examine how customer react on cross-channel integration in omnichannel retailing through the Push-Pull-Mooring (PPM) framework. The authors reveal that uncertainty, identity attractiveness, and switching costs play pushing, pulling, and mooring roles, respectively, in affecting customers’ reaction to cross-channel integration.</p>
<p>For future research agenda, we propose three research questions: i) How does social influence play a role in the omnichannel retailing? ii) What are individual preferences towards omnichannel retailing? iii) What is consumers’ reaction to the new technology adoptions, such as AI, VR (or AR), blockchain, etc. (Li et al.&nbsp;(2018a); Zhu et al., 2013).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="omnichannel-customers-preferences">Omnichannel customers’ preferences</h3>
<p>Brynjolfsson et al.&nbsp;(2009) also study product selection problems and geographical impacts in cross-channel competition between traditional brick-and-mortar retailer and Internet retailers. The authors find that Internet retailers face more competition in selling everyday products but have more advantages in selling niche products. The findings suggest managers consider the types of products sold in different retail channels.</p>
<p>Dzyabura and Jagabathula (2018) explore the products selection problems on both offline and online channels and address the optimal offline assortment choice to maximize both channels’ profits. The authors show that measuring the impact of offline assortment on online sales gains up to 40% expected revenue. Dzyabura et al.&nbsp;(2019) investigate consumers’ online and offline product evaluations and demonstrate a large discrepancy existing the two evaluations: one is the offline “live”; the other is online description. The authors propose two statistical methods: a hierarchical Bayesian approach and a k-nearest-neighbors approach for better evaluating the offline and online products.</p>

<section id="discussions-and-recommendation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discussions-and-recommendation">Discussions and recommendation</h3>
<p>After the main path analysis of the 7 research domains, we find that the extant literature seldom examines the roles of how new technologies play in the “omnichannel management”. The technological advancements (e.g., digitalization, AI, VR, mobile apps, mobile payment, etc.) create opportunities for omnichannel retailing. As these technologies blur the distinction between the offline and online shopping and are changing the retail landscape, the retailers and their supply chain collaborators have to reconsider their competitive strategies (Brynjolfsson et al., 2013). We name the supporting technologies for “omnichannel management” as “Omni-tech”.</p>
<p>Moreover, the domain of supply chain management and inventory management in the omnichannel environment is absent in this systematic literature review.</p>
<p>First, PFOM can guild the retail firms to implement a comprehensive omnichannel strategy. Second, PFOM shows the emerging important elements which the retail firms should pay attention to in their omnichannel management, such as the role of omni-tech. Last but not the least, with an effective omnichannel management strategy, retail firms can possess more competitive advantage in the retailing market.</p>

<p>The increasing importance of integrated fulfillment concepts revitalizes bricks-and-mortar stores and puts them at the center of retail operations. So-called omnichannel (OC) concepts leverage stores to offer seamless and enhanced operations for offline and online shoppers. Stores are used to fulfill online orders, offer shorter lead times to customers, and extend the assortment across channels. The role of the store and the underlying store operations are thus impacted by profound changes. This transformation has not yet been assessed comprehensively from a practical or an Operations Research (OR) lens.</p>
<p>This paper identifies cross-cutting store-related planning issues and develops a planning framework for OC operations. We apply industry interviews and a systematic literature analysis to derive five planning issues. Research gaps are revealed by matching the pertinent OR literature with managerial needs. The planning issues network design of fulfillment locations, assignment of customer orders, and assortment and inventory planning have been discussed in several store-related OC publications. Demand forecasting and inventory replenishment have received less coverage, and offer significant research opportunities.</p>
<p>In the past, the online shop mainly supplemented stores. Now, stores not only supplement online sales but are also becoming a central piece of the customer journey across seamlessly integrated channels.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the expansion of such offerings and reinforced the store’s role change from being purely a sales area to also acting as a logistics fulfillment hub. The integration of stores and digital channels is called omnichannel (OC). The store now serves as the epicenter for OC retail operations, functioning as an additional warehouse for online orders besides the traditional purpose as a customer shopping area (see e.g., Brynjolfsson et al.&nbsp;[2013]; Bell et al.&nbsp;[2014]; Gallino et al.&nbsp;[2017]; Gallino and Moreno [2019]; Janjevic et al.&nbsp;[2020]).</p>
<p>As stores may now be used as alternative picking locations, retailers have to decide which stores to include in their fulfillment network and from which specific location to pick each online order. In addition, assortments and inventory levels for each point of sales need to be determined, and how they are to be shared across locations. This requires quantifying, modeling and solving the trade-off between costs and operational advantages.</p>
<p>The overview shows that current reviews lack topicality (e.g., Swaminathan and Tayur [2003]; Agatz et al.&nbsp;[2008]), an OR perspective on the store (e.g., Kembro et al.&nbsp;[2018]; Bijmolt et al.&nbsp;[2021]), or an analysis of latest developments in practice (e.g., Galipoglu et al.&nbsp;[2018]; Melacini et al.&nbsp;[2018]). This is aggravated by cross-cutting OC operations topics, which are not fully discussed and evaluated by the literature reviews. Examples include an integrated assortment for buy online pick-up in store purchases (see e.g., Rooderkerk and Kök [2019]; Hübner and Hense [2021]), the fulfillment of online orders through stores (see e.g., Ishfaq and Bajwa [2019]; Arslan et al.&nbsp;[2020]; Bayram and Cesaret [2020]), or the consideration of a single virtual stock for all fulfillment locations (see e.g., Aflaki and Swinney [2021]).</p>
<p>First, we structurally identify the most relevant store-related planning issues derived from interviews with industry experts (RQ1). Second, we match this overview with an analysis of existing literature and evaluate whether and to what extent these planning issues are covered in pertinent analytical and modeling literature (RQ2). We use the combination of RQ1 and RQ2 to ensure a structured literature analysis that responds to retailers’ challenges and reveals answers in the literature. Third, the combination of both questions makes it possible to state which planning issues are not yet sufficiently covered and offer further research potential (RQ3).</p>
<p>OC operations imply fully integrated channels where consumers can shop without noticing the different channels operating in the background (e.g., which picking location was used). It extends the multichannel (MC) concept, which characterized retailers with various isolated sales channels, such as an online shop (henceforth referred to as “webshop”) and a bricksand-mortar store (henceforth referred to as “store”).</p>
<p>The resulting OC-enabled fulfillment concepts (henceforth referred to as “OC concepts”) are ship-fromstore (SFS), buy online pick-up in store (BOPS), and digital assortment extension (DAE). As “ordering at store” and “receiving at store” when taken together constitutes conventional in-store shopping and not an OC concept, we will not further study this aspect.</p>
<p><strong>Buy Online Pick-up in Store</strong> (BOPS, also called click and collect) enables demand transfer from the webshop to the store. Customers can order online to pick up products in the store, possibly while observing store inventory This practice helps to shorten lead times or to substitute unavailable webshop items by redirecting customers to the store where the item is available. A variation depicts reserve online, pick-up and pay in store (ROPS), where items are reserved online but payment is only carried out in the store upon pick-up.</p>
<p><strong>Ship-from-store (SFS)</strong> describes the process of accessing store inventory for online orders and using stores as an alternative fulfillment location to distribution centers (DCs) (see e.g., Hübner et al.&nbsp;[2016a]; Difrancesco et al.&nbsp;[2021]). Orders are picked in the store and shipped directly to the customer. Benefits arise from shorter transportation distances to customers compared to remote DCs and from inventory pooling across different locations.</p>
<p>A <strong>Digital assortment extension (DAE)</strong> provides an “endless aisle” to the store via demand transfer from the store to the webshop. Digital devices in the store enable access to the online assortment and expand the store’s offering. In an extreme variant of DAE, the store has no sales inventory and only serves as a showroom with digital order options.</p>
<p>It requires the integration and coordination of operations, resources, and information systems and entails novel structures and planning systems. This creates the need to identify and analyze the planning problems that are affected the most by the transition towards OC concepts. In particular, enhanced approaches across channels are required for the demand forecast, the selection of fulfillment locations of online orders and the assortment and inventory definition. We aim to distill the essentials of the new role of the store in OC operations. We therefore analyze OC retail settings with integrated channels. This leads us to focus on tactical and operational planning problems, which excludes strategic aspects like moving from SC or MC to OC. Furthermore, we focus on the impact of operations and stores.</p>
<p>The empirical findings in Section 3 are structured along five elements (demand forecasts, network design of fulfillment locations, assignment of customer orders, assortment and inventory management, and inventory replenishment) that emerged from our conceptual overview, expert interviews and literature analysis. Each element depicts one planning issue. The elements are structured along planning horizons and their relation to each other.</p>
<p>OC merges operations across channels. This brings forth planning questions on how to match supply and demand across channels and puts the store at the center of those operations. In particular, it requires answers as to what and how much to offer and where to process an order across integrated channels. However, integral planning implies more complex approaches with multidimensional interdependencies. Efficient planning of the entire OC operations is neither possible in the form of a monolithic system that plans all tasks simultaneously nor by simply performing the various planning steps successively.</p>

<section id="challenges-in-practice" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenges-in-practice">Challenges in practice</h4>
<p>OC retailers are confronted with issues related to accurate demand forecasts that can be clustered into three areas. First, a sufficient historical OC database and OC experiences are often unavailable due to very recent OC service enhancements and significant developments of OC shopping.</p>
<p>Second, demand models across channels are required to capture additional customer attributes. It becomes more challenging to understand customer needs and how customers use channels to make a purchasing decision, such as, if one channel is used for the information search and another for product purchases. Furthermore, existing SC or MC models used by retailers do not sufficiently capture OC demand flows across channels, e.g., substitutions from store to online. The positive impact of webshop promotions on online demand, for instance, may have a negative impact on store demand. To increase OC forecasting accuracy, one needs to identify relevant drivers of demand. Such drivers may include external factors such as weather, season, or the activities of a competitor and internal factors such as advertisements across or within a channel.</p>
<p>Third, DAE demand is greatly influenced by in-store inventory as customers often use DAE orders to buy temporarily sold out, out-of-stock (OOS) items. However, in-store inventory information is often not reliable or available in real-time, making predictions more difficult. This may result in censored demand observations since sales are limited by the supply information the is available.</p>

<section id="challenges-in-practice-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenges-in-practice-1">Challenges in practice</h4>
<p>OC retailers pointed out challenges with selecting the appropriate fulfillment locations that can be clustered around three topics: development paths, operational efficiency, and heterogeneous depots.</p>
<p>The enduring business problem here is to define the optimal volume processed in stores. Processing in stores has benefits compared to DCs if stores are in customer proximity.</p>
<p>Second, the share of online sales processed via stores has operational and economic limitations despite the benefits due to lower delivery times</p>
<p>Finally, the location selection becomes more relevant but also more complex when retailers hold a number of heterogeneous depots, e.g., DCs and stores with different assortments and fulfillment costs.</p>
<p>In the course of recent introductions of OC concepts, most retailers decided on fulfillment locations based on speed and ease of implementation and only partially based on induced costs.</p>
<p>Mahar et al.&nbsp;[2012] extend the problem to offer stores for BOPS in a dynamic fashion. Each time an online customer reaches checkout, the model uses information on current inventory levels and expected demands to specify which of the stores should be presented as available pick-up locations. The policy attempts to discard stores with low inventory levels. The authors formulate a decision problem to minimize the total costs of inventory holding and backorder as well as lost sales and redirecting customers (so called customer goodwill costs).</p>
<p>Mahar et al.&nbsp;[2014] fixed setup and inventory holding costs favor central fulfillment from the DC, whereas transportation and goodwill costs favor providing pick-up/return at all stores to essentially pass “free shipping” costs to the customer and avoid any lost sales.</p>
</section>
<section id="future-areas-of-research" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="future-areas-of-research">Future areas of research</h4>
<p>Current literature on network design has originated from inventory allocation problems and developed since then to more comprehensive cost functions, demand models and decision criteria. However, matching challenges from practice with literature highlights some research gaps. These would range from providing models and solutions for the expanding services, using inventory pooling across stores, more deeply grounding the relevant costs empirically, extending models to include dynamic and stochastic demand effects, through to developing managerial insights and assessing the impact of new technologies related to store operations.</p>
<p>The question arises as to whether orders for customer pick-up in stores should directly be picked in the store (with potentially higher picking costs and lower availability), in DCs, or in other stores for delivery to the pick-up store. Furthermore, retailers will benefit from BOPS when this can be used for cross-selling opportunities in the store. This entails the research questions on how cross-selling can be materialized. A further opportunity in this context are processes and decision rules when redirecting customers to SFS or DAE is an option.</p>
<p>A second area of research opportunities deals with related costs. Although recent literature considers a broader set of costs (e.g., Ishfaq and Bajwa [2019]), a cost-holistic comparison of different fulfillment locations is still limited.</p>
<p>The third area is related to modeling approaches. In many cases independent demand models are applied that do not factor in cross-channel demand when strictly prioritizing online (e.g., Bendoly [2004]; Chen et al.&nbsp;[2011]) or offline (e.g., Hovelaque et al.&nbsp;[2007]) demand, for example.</p>
<p>However, the location selection problem may be a dynamic problem with opening and closures (e.g., because of seasonal demand) and therefore requires to extend the cost functions by opening/closing costs or inseason replenishment costs. Furthermore, the demand is subject to variations which then need to be built into stochastic demand models.</p>
<p>Extending the more comprehensive cost formulations (e.g., by Ishfaq and Raja [2018] and Ishfaq and Bajwa [2019]) by the dynamic and stochastic components and incorporating further variables (e.g., dynamic adjustments) requires advanced solution approaches. This also includes innovative approaches to take into account actual transportation costs.</p>
<p>Finally, there are further research opportunities with the use of new technologies. Efficiency gains via automation might come into play when process automation leads to lower fulfillment costs in certain locations. ### Assignment of customer orders to fulfillment locations #### Scope of the planning problem Whereas the network problem determines the set of available fulfillment locations, the related and subsequent operational problem is the actual assignment of online orders to the locations selected mid-term. At this stage, OC retailers specifically consider the currently available inventories and picking capacities at each location as well as lead times and requested time windows.</p>
<p>The assignment of orders aims to minimize the total costs consisting of inventory (i.e., costs for inventory holding and overand underage), picking (i.e., processing an order at fulfillment location), and transportation costs (i.e., from inventory location to customers).</p>
</section>
<section id="challenges-in-practice-2" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenges-in-practice-2">Challenges in practice</h4>
<p>The challenges related to order assignment build upon the efficiency, heterogeneity, and capacity issues for the selection of locations discussed above. Further questions on the operational level arise from the necessity to include inventories available in real-time at each location. In a fully integrated SFS concept, customers can select all products offered in stores at the online checkout. As a consequence, it needs to be based on real-time product availability in each location.</p>
<p>Using inventories in stores for the fulfillment of online orders decreases the inventory available for in-store revenues and may require more store space if inventories are increased, but may decrease fulfillment costs and lead time for online orders.</p>
<p>Offering BOPS leads to situations where retailers have to prioritize orders, e.g., if an in-store customer wants to purchase an item that is already reserved for a BOPS order. Further, unclaimed BOPS orders take-up valuable space in the store. Moreover, the in-store customer would buy certainly the product, whereas there is also a risk that the customer who reserved the product online may not show up and buy it. OC retailers therefore require order acceptance rules and avoid accepting all orders on a first-come-first-served principle.</p>
<p>As one DIY retailer (DIY01) explained, order splitting requires additional processes and operations regarding downstream order consolidation before delivery or substitutions between products. To mitigate these challenges, retailers think about steering customers into other channels (e.g., SFS instead of BOPS) in the event of stock-outs, giving retailers flexibility in accessing different inventories.</p>
<p>Bretthauer et al.&nbsp;[2010] are the first to apply a two-echelon fulfillment system with a DC and multiple stores. Incoming goods are received at the DC, which serves as a break bulk facility. Goods are then shipped to the stores in equal quantities. After that, each store incurs independent store and online demand. The online demand originates from the surrounding region. They apply a static order assignment policy so that each online customer is served from the closest store.</p>
<p>In a further extension, Mahar and Wright [2009] introduce an assignment policy where the online orders are accumulated over time and allocations are made after a time interval. This further reduces costs. However, common across these models is that they are limited to one product and the transportation costs to customers are only modeled with direct shipments. They thus use distance metrics even when customers are served together within a tour.</p>
<p>Andrews et al.&nbsp;[2019] is the first contribution with multiple products. They apply an online optimization approach and solve a multi-criteria decision problem with an algorithm based on a primal-dual schema. Their model assigns orders to stores and a DC based on available inventory, transportation costs, lead time and picking capabilities.</p>
<p>Dethlefs et al.&nbsp;[2021] develop and apply a cluster-first-route-second algorithm that assigns orders to a heterogeneous set of picking locations. They are the first to consider locationand product-specific picking costs, vehicle routing costs, and to also assign orders to tours. They show that integrated fulfillment from both stores and DCs can be beneficial, especially under time restrictions when orders must be fulfilled rapidly.</p>

<section id="future-area-of-research" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="future-area-of-research">Future area of research</h4>
<p>There are opportunities for further research in extending the assignment problem to BOPS and DAE concepts, enhancing models with further decision-relevant costs and criteria and last but not least, investigating lead-time aspects. The first area is related to the OC concepts. Table 3 shows that BOPS and DAE have not been studied for order assignment. However, these could also leverage the advantages of location assignment. While customers choose a specific store for order pick-up (in BOPS), the picking process can be handled in other locations with the aim of minimizing costs or using spare capacities and stocks, e.g., in particular at the end of sales season. Similarly, DAE has not been discussed, but may become relevant if online customers have digital access to inventories across stores.</p>
<p>The second topic area is related to the fulfillment costs considered and other factors. A holistic assignment decision consists of two cost categories: depot-specific processing costs (incl.&nbsp;inventory, picking) and transportation costs (incl.&nbsp;last-mile delivery to customers). The assignment decision depends on inventory positions, picking systems at a depot, as well as transportation means and options for routing.</p>
<p>One needs to further analyze the impact of order assignment on customers in stores based on current practical challenges and the primary concern of many store managers. How does a certain level of customer presence in stores impact assignment decisions? Assignment decisions may therefore be impacted not just by the available inventory in addition to costs but also by store customer presence and picking capacity. Finally, an increasing demand for shorter delivery times (i.e., same hour, same day) and the use of tight time windows raise questions regarding how these factors impact assignment decisions.</p>

<section id="assortment-and-inventory" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="assortment-and-inventory">Assortment and inventory</h3>
<p>Assortment and inventory planning is concerned with the selection of products and stocking levels across channels, DCs and stores. This is a tactical decision that needs to be accomplished with the operational inventory replenishment.</p>
<section id="scope-of-planning-problem" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scope-of-planning-problem">Scope of planning problem</h4>
<p>To optimize retailers’ profit, assortment planners must decide, out of all potentially available products, which set of products to list in which channel and inventory location (DCs and stores), which products to make available for BOPS, SFS, and DAE, and in which quantities.</p>
<p>Assortment composition and inventory target levels must be defined jointly as these decisions are interdependent when space in the store or the online DC is limited.</p>
<p>A meaningful allocation of products and inventories to the webshop and stores can be achieved to serve customers across channels by disentangling and quantifying demand transitions between channels and products. In OC retailing, not only in-channel substitutions but also demand transitions between the webshop and stores and vice versa are very common [Rooderkerk and Kök, 2019]. Next to OC-specific demand, OC assortment and inventory planning must consider product margins, distribution and replenishment costs as well as inventory holding costs for each inventory location. To quantify the demand fulfillment, it becomes additionally necessary to consider over- or underage costs.</p>
</section>
<section id="challenges-in-practice-3" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenges-in-practice-3">Challenges in practice</h4>
<p>Enabled through OC information systems, customers use multiple channels along their purchasing journey and frequently change channels to gather pre-purchase product information (i.e., research-online, purchase-offline behavior, and vice versa), change preferences, and substitute products. This requires demand models that integrate such cross-channel customer effects as well as inventory location and product-specific economics. Assessing these effects and costs of varying assortments across stores and the webshop on customer demand is a challenge.</p>
<p>A new aspect is the he product and channel complementarity. For instance, being able to offer a broader assortment in one category might convey the impression of elevated competencies in this category and lead to additional sales. On the same line, offering a complementary channel to existing channels provides both a source of supplementary information and additional substitution possibilities for customers. Transferable substitution demand, walk-rates, and cannibalization become even more crucial as a result, but also harder to estimate.</p>
<p>Moreover, OC assortment planning requires the incorporation of different revenue and cost structures of products and fulfillment locations via the introduction of OC concepts.</p>
<p>This is however often done without profound insights into channel buying and switching behavior and reduces the potential of revenue-driving OC concepts. The decision on what and how much to offer via BOPS, SFS, and DAE is often either somewhat disregarded or not based on channel-specific cost, revenue and demand implications. #### Current research The models above provide some first approaches to derive analytically inventory target levels in operations across channels. The OC concepts applied are limited to one product and disregard assortment compositions. A main limitation for the application to practice is the consideration of channels without specifying the inventory for concrete stores. Furthermore, the models are not comprehensive in terms of substitutions between and within sales locations as well as considering actual fulfillment costs.</p>
<p>The second related stream comprises assortment planning. Gu and Tayi [2017] use an analytical model to analyze research-offline, purchase-online behavior for a retailer with a webshop and a store with a connected DAE. The retailer decides on products, what price to sell them at, and whether to sell the products via both channels or only the webshop. In the store, customers receive information about the available product(s) and thereby fully resolve their product uncertainty on available products or reduce their uncertainty about unavailable products. Subsequent online purchases are enabled via DAE for products not available in the store. Customers can return products after evaluating the product received. Inventory levels are not defined, substitution rates are not considered, and costs are limited to handling returned products. Dzyabura and Jagabathula [2018] also formulate a NLP and propose a greedy heuristic to solve the problem. They consider showrooming as a special case of DAE where the store assortment is optimized without optimizing inventories. Out of a given set of products in the online channel, the retailer decides on the subset of products to offer in the store. The impact of the store assortment on online demand is factored into these considerations.</p>
<p>They apply SFS and model inventory and assortment optimization with OOS situations in the online DC. This is the first contribution with more detailed fulfillment costs. The retailer selects the assortment and inventory target levels for a store with limited shelf space and for the online channel with limited DC capacity.</p>
</section>
<section id="future-areas-of-research-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="future-areas-of-research-1">Future areas of research</h4>
<p>Current literature provides structural insights into assortment compositions and inventory levels across channels. However, many models lack the integration of comprehensive demand models with substitutions across and within channels, incomplete fulfillment costs and overly simplistic assumptions such as pre-defined online assortments and inventories.</p>
<p>To advance the OC operations literature, research opportunities lie in a more thorough consideration of demand effects across channels, stores as showrooms, cost and revenue parameters, safety stocks, and more solution approaches applicable for practice.</p>
<p>First of all, relevant customer search behavior across channels, as well as substitution, complementary, and cross-selling effects, must be taken into account when configuring OC assortments.</p>
<p>Alongside that, product and channel complementarity as well as cross- and upselling opportunities are worth integrating. It is also crucial to respect relevant single- and multichannel demand effects such as space-elasticity and cross-space elasticity in the bricks-and-mortar store (see e.g., Hansen and Heinsbroek [1979], Chandon et al.&nbsp;[2009], Eisend [2014], or Schaal and Hübner [2018]), or positioning- and salienceeffects on a web page (see e.g., Djamasbi et al.&nbsp;[2010], Pieters et al.&nbsp;[2010], or Atalay et al.&nbsp;[2012]).</p>
<p>Secondly, assortment and inventory related research is necessary for showrooms. Showrooms depict a specific case as the stores display products but only sell them through DAE.</p>
<p>Thirdly, OC retailers must look beyond pure unit costs and revenues and take total profitability and feasibility into account. OC retailers need to identify all decision-relevant costs, including unit and purchasing costs but also fulfillment costs, safety stock cost, salvage values, shortage costs, and hidden OC costs. This concerns products bought through cross-channel research, BOPS, SFS, or DAE, causing information provision or fulfillment costs across different channels. Feasibility, on the other hand, mainly describes whether it is operationally possible to offer OC concepts for certain products.</p>
<p>A further factor that has not yet been considered in inventory management in OC is the determination of safety stocks for each sales and inventory location. As one inventory location can back up others and provide substitutions across channels, this also constitutes a novel problem caused by OC operations. Finally, we have seen that in practice, many assortment and inventory models fall short of accounting in a practical manner where OC demand effects are concerned. Given the magnitude such effects can have on profits, retailers require related decision support that is not only easily applicable but also delivers efficient solutions without extensive OC data that is potentially unavailable. In these cases, algorithms to estimate demand probabilities are required to obtain inputs for more detailed demand models.</p>

<p>Inventory replenishment is the subsequent planning step after the midterm assortment and target inventory level definition. It deals with when and how much to refill. Retailers need to define the replenishment frequency (when) and quantity (how much) for each inventory location (stores and DCs) after actual customer orders have been fulfilled to meet the specified inventory target levels.</p>
</section>
<section id="challenges-in-practice-4" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenges-in-practice-4">Challenges in practice</h4>
<p>OC retailers face difficulties achieving real-time inventory accuracy, managing cross-channel product returns, and orchestrating OC replenishment rules that integrate dependent decision systems.</p>
<p>First, obtaining real-time inventory transparency and accuracy, i.e., “which SKU is available in which moment in which location” constitutes the most critical challenge.</p>
<p>The causes of this problem are manifold. A large number of OC channels and different fulfillment concepts complicate the management and recording of accurate data. Manual errors such as late checkouts of SFS products further impair the IRI in this context. Moreover, a lack of integrated POS inventory control systems across different channels and along different stages of the retail supply chain, as well as low data update frequencies, prevent real-time inventory visibility.</p>
<p>A further complication is the option to return online orders in the store. Finally, managers are urged to optimize inventory control to avoid unnecessary stockouts and rush orders, or overstocks, respectively.</p>
<p>OC demand forecasting, assortment and inventory planning, replenishment costs, and inventory accuracy serve as inputs, which are often incomplete or faulty. Such deficiencies require higher cycle inventories or safety stocks.</p>
</section>
<section id="current-research" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="current-research">Current research</h4>
<p>Govindarajan et al.&nbsp;[2020] extend the problem to multiple inventory locations (i.e., multiple stores and DCs), but again only for a single product. Optimal order-up-to levels are defined within a stochastic dynamic problem for each location and each review period. While store demand is fulfilled as it arrives, incoming online orders are fulfilled by shipping from DCs or SFS, depending on a threshold fulfillment policy. The model accounts for shortage, overage, inventory holding, and distance-dependent unit costs (i.e., picking, packing, labeling, and shipping), but disregards demand interactions between the channels or stores. A specialized heuristic for integrated inventory planning and fulfillment is applied.</p>
</section>
<section id="future-areas-of-research-2" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="future-areas-of-research-2">Future areas of research</h4>
<p>The papers analyzed above help to determine replenishment quantities in varying OC settings. However, all of the models suffer from constrained OC concepts, costs, and demand as well as problem sizes. Practically relevant future research can be obtained from models that represent real-life settings, the consideration of OC returns, the incorporation of inventory accuracy, and advances in short-term revenue management.</p>
<p>First, it is necessary to extend the scope in terms of products and inventory locations and OC concepts.</p>
<p>Second, the existing literature does not sufficiently close the gap between OC returns and inventory control. Most evidently, models considering the reintegration of returns to the stores or returns via shipment to the online DC while also looking at OC concepts are lacking. Also, the actual replenishment and return costs (e.g., picking, packing, labeling and transportation costs between DCs and stores) are so far only partially factored in by Govindarajan et al.&nbsp;[2020].</p>
<p>Third, a problem that did not seem to receive any attention in the current OC literature is the management of IRI, despite being the most critical issue in OC inventory control according to practitioners (see also Hauser et al.&nbsp;[2020]).</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Last but no least, while we have outlined connections between the planning issues identified, we have not assessed the dependencies in detail. A model that quantitatively assesses the horizontal and vertical interdependencies of planning steps is still necessary. Here, one can investigate for example how designing the network of fulfillment locations can alter assortment availability. Similarly, defining assortments across channels can be analyzed by considering options for replenishment practices and returns in the channels. Moreover, there is most certainly a wide array of further dependencies with planning aspects outside our scope. Hence, we encourage embedding the store-related planning issues within a greater framework that also covers topics such as purchasing and warehousing or areas related to marketing operations such as product or delivery pricing and promotions. Setting prices for both products and delivery services heavily impacts demand, which feeds subsequent decisions.</p>

<p>The authors review 50 empirical retailing research papers that have appeared over the last 20 years to take stock of what we know, need to know better, and do not know yet about within-retailer cross-channel effects of omnichannel retail marketing strategies on (a) consumer responses over their purchase journeys, i.e., online and/or offline search, purchase intention, frequency, amount, returns, loyalty, and (b) the retail firm’s aggregate outcomes (e.g., sales, costs, profits, product returns) by channel and overall. Specifically, the authors focus on five strategies: (1) the addition of online channel by an offline retailer; (2) the addition (or subtraction) of offline channels by an online retailer; (3) addition of mobile shopping channel (website and/or app) by offline and/or online retailer; (4) cross-channel integration strategies; and (5) retail marketing mix strategies. The author/s integrate findings from empirical research on these strategies into a number of ‘insights’ about ‘what we know’. Prominent among these are the following: Adding a transactional online channel to an offline channel improves the retailer’s overall sales even though offline channel sales can be cannibalized to some degree. Adding an offline channel by an online retailer, however, boosts online channel sales as well as overall sales of the retailer. Similarly, adding a mobile shopping channel usually increases customer purchase frequency and amount and overall sales of the retailer in the long-term. Strategies for greater cross-channel integration generally have a positive effect on a retailer’s overall performance while online advertising has positive effects on offline channel consideration and sales as well as overall sales of a multichannel retailer. Other insights or findings that need further study or open questions are also identified. The paper closes with managerial implications of the derived empirical insights, and suggestions for future research.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="brief-2">Brief</h2>
<p>a 2017 survey of 43000 shoppers of one multichannel retailer reported in Harvard Business Review found that 73% of the study participants were omnichannel customers, i.e., used multiple channels during their shopping journey (Sopadjieva, Dholakia, and Benjamin 2017).</p>
<p>This article is then aimed at: (1) taking stock of the data-driven insights about cross-channel effects currently available in the retailing research literature that can guide the development of effective omnichannel strategies by retailers, whether they currently be offline only, online only, or multichannel retailers; and (2) identifying questions for further research.</p>
<p>In the present paper, we broadly define the cross-channel effects as spillover effects of a retailer’s addition or deletion of one channel, or marketing actions within that channel, on consumer responses and retailer outcomes in its other channel/s.</p>
<p>The focal five classes of retail marketing strategies are then: (1) ‘adding clicks to bricks’, i.e., adding online channel by an offline channels retailer; (2) ‘adding bricks to clicks’ i.e., adding (or possibly closing) offline channel outlets, e.g., physical stores, pop-up stores or showrooms by a retailer with an online channel; (3) adding a mobile shopping channel, i.e., provision of a website adapted to tablet or smartphone formats and/or a mobile app (i.e., a program that is downloaded and installed onto a user’s mobile device that is another purchase channel, e.g., Liu et al.&nbsp;2019) by online, offline, or multichannel retailer; (4) cross-channel integration strategies; and (5) retail marketing mix strategies.</p>
<p>A customer engages with the retailer along their purchase journey or path to purchase differently for different purposes at different decision stages of their journey. The customer’s journey is typically depicted as a five-stage path (e.g., Levy, Weitz and Grewal 2018) comprising need recognition, evaluation, consideration, purchase, and post-purchase. In this paper, however, we follow the lead of scholars such as Grewal &amp; Roggeveen (2020), Lemon &amp; Verhoef (2016), Shavitt &amp; Barnes (2020) in defining the customer journey as comprised of three stages: prepurchase (e.g., ‘search’), purchase (e.g., transaction), and post-purchase (e.g., review, returns, repeat) and use this definition to explain the three main components our conceptual framework and their interactions in more depth below.</p>
<p>Based on the customer’s journey, we can broadly conceptualize five customer types depicted in Fig. 2: single-channel customers, multichannel customers, webroomers and showroomers, and omnichannel customers.</p>
<p>Single-channel customers (Fig. 2a) are those shoppers who use the same channel, either online or offline, throughout their purchase journey whenever they shop, regardless of the retailer’s channel strategy. Multichannel customers may use all the multichannel options of retailers, but on different shopping occasions or purchase journeys, i.e., they are singlechannel on any particular shopping occasion. Webroomers (Fig. 2b) and Showroomers (Fig. 2c) are customers who typically complete the purchase stage from the same channel (online for Showroomers and offline for Webroomers), but perform the pre-purchase stage, i.e., ’search’, in the other channel (Gensler, Neslin, and Verhoef 2017). Lastly, omnichannel customers (Fig. 2d) freely utilize different channels and may crossover at any stage – pre-purchase, purchase, or postpurchase - from one channel to another (perhaps multiple times) along a shopping journey. (In this respect, webroomers or showroomers are special cases of omnichannel shoppers.) They can buy online and pick-up from the store (‘BOPS’) or return products at stores (‘BORS’). They can even perform the same stage in both channels, e.g., search in both offline stores and online website.</p>
<p>The omnichannel retailer engages in omnichannel management as defined, e.g., by Verhoef, Kannan, &amp; Inman (2015), i.e., the synergetic management of its multiple channels and customer touchpoints, in such a way that the customer experience across channels and the performance over channels is optimized.</p>
<p>Lastly, we concentrated on papers that had empirical findings bearing on the following objective consumer-level response measures and retailer outcomes. Specifically, on the consumer side, one or more measures related to ‘prepurchase’, e.g., channel choice; ‘purchase’, i.e., purchase intention, purchase frequency, purchase amount (spending level); and ‘post-purchase’ e.g., product returns, and loyalty to the retailer. As regards retailer outcomes, we focused on papers with findings related to one or more of the following outcome measures: aggregate customer visits, retailer sales, costs, returns, profitability by channel, and overall.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adding-clicks-to-bricks-rq1">Adding’ clicks to bricks’ (RQ1)</h3>
<p><strong>Insight R1.1:</strong> Cannibalization of offline channel sales by a newly added online channel can occur but this effect is highly variable, ranging from negligible to over 90%, depending on the retail setting.</p>
<p>“Cannibalization” of existing customers’ offline sales by a newly added online channel in some defined time period is the proportion of total online sales to existing offline customers in that period attributable to sales displaced from the offline channel.</p>
<p>Pozzi’s (2013) study found that the Internet channel led to a 13% increase in overall sales with 95% of this effect coming from increased expenditure by existing offline consumers, but with only limited cannibalization at the household level. That is, on average, for every dollar spent online by an existing customer, this study found 67 cents represented fresh business, and only 33 cents were displaced from the retailer’s offline sales. However, a study by Hernant &amp; Rosengren (2017) reported a higher cannibalization rate than the previous studies. These researchers used consumer-level data, very similar to that utilized by Pozzi (2013), but drawn from a non-grocery retail setting. They found over 90% cannibalization by a newly introduced online channel within 15 months of its opening.</p>
<p>This divergence is likely attributable to the different product categories, retailer settings and customer types involved in these studies but needs more investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Insight R1.2:</strong> Adding an online channel by a hitherto offline retailer has a positive effect on overall retailer performance.</p>
<p>The Internet channel may be generating new business due to attracting new segments of customers who never utilized the offline channel (e.g., Deleersnyder et al.&nbsp;2002) or, because of greater convenience (e,g., reduction in search or travel costs), growth in online equity (Biyalogorsky and Naik 2003) or diverting business from rival supermarkets and other substitutes, e.g., restaurants (Pozzi 2013).</p>
<p><strong>Insight R1.3:</strong> The effects of addition of an online informational (’search’) website on offline customer purchase frequency and spending amount can be negative for some product categories and customer segments.</p>
<p>They suggested these negative effects are attributable to more planned shopping enabled by the information available on the website and greater ability to easily compare the retailer’s offerings with those of competitive stores in deciding where to shop. However, another study in the same empirical data setting by Pauwels et al.&nbsp;(2011) reported more nuanced findings. Specifically, lower online search costs are especially beneficial for sensory products and for customers distant from the store. Customers in some segments buy more expensive products, suggesting that online search and offline purchases are complements, while customers in other segments reduce their shopping trips, suggesting their online activities partially substitute for experiential shopping in the physical stores.</p>

<section id="adding-bricks-to-clicks-rq2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adding-bricks-to-clicks-rq2">Adding’ bricks to clicks’ (RQ2)</h3>
<p><strong>Insight R2.1:</strong> B&amp;M stores openings have a positive longterm effect on online channel sales, especially where the online presence is weak, and boost overall performance of the retailer.</p>
<p><strong>Insight R2.2:</strong> B&amp;M store openings tend to cannibalize catalog sales in the short term and increase product returns.</p>
<p>The authors found that while physical store openings decrease catalog sales in the short term, they had no short-term effect on Internet channel sales. Further, sales increase in both catalog and Internet channels in the long run, but more so in the online channel. Furthermore, the store openings stimulated long-run increases in first-time and repeat customer counts in the non-store channels leading Avery et al.&nbsp;(2012) to conclude that the addition of bricks to clicks has a long-term complementary effect, with stores acting as the brand’s billboard.</p>
<p>Pauwels &amp; Neslin (2015) also found that while store introduction cannibalizes catalog sales, it did not affect Internet sales. Also, while product returns and exchanges increased, so did overall sales. Transaction size of purchases, returns, and exchanges did not change.</p>
<p>Further, Wang and Goldfarb observe a large increase in new customer acquisition and overall sales. They conclude that although online and offline channels may be substitutes in distribution, they are complements in marketing communications that effectively inform consumers about the existence of the brand.</p>
<p>Kumar, Mehra &amp; Kumar (2019) posit that a store engagement effect – the probability of interaction due to a physical store - is the reason for the increase in online purchases. They also find that allowing customers to purchase online and return the product in-store plays a significant role in increasing online sales for an omnichannel retailer. Kumar, Mehra &amp; Kumar (2019) also found opening a physical store increases overall sales.</p>
<p><strong>Insight R2.3:</strong> A well-advertised pop-up store, or showroom, has a complementary effect on sales of a hitherto online retailer.</p>
<p><strong>Insight R2.4:</strong> A showroom boosts the retailer’s overall performance.</p>
<p>Moreno (2015) report that showroom openings had a positive overall demand increase impact of 10%, while in locations with showrooms, direct sales through website increased by 7%.</p>
<p>Moreover, showroom openings generate operational spillovers and increase overall operational efficiency by: (1) attracting customers who, on average, have a higher cost-to-serve; (2) increasing conversion in a sampling channel; and (3) decreasing purchase returns.</p>
<p><strong>Insight R2.5:</strong> Closing offline channel (e.g., catalog, stores) can have a negative effect on customers’ purchase incidence and loyalty to the retailer.</p>
</section>
<section id="adding-mobile-channel" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adding-mobile-channel">Adding mobile channel</h3>
<p>A mobile channel allows consumers to use their smartphone or tablet devices to visit, search and order from the retailer’s online webstore or via a downloadable mobile app of the retailer.</p>
<p><strong>Insight R3.1:</strong> Adding mobile shopping channel by onlineonly retailer cannibalizes retailer’s existing online channel customers’ purchases in the short term but boosts the retailer’s overall sales in the long term and increases consumers’ online purchase frequency and order size, especially for previously low spenders.</p>
<p>Specifically, the addition of the mobile channel increased the overall revenue from channel adopters by 18.4%. Mobile channel complements the online channel in time-critical searches and triggers additional transactions on the online channel.</p>
<p>They found, first, as customers develop the habit of M-shopping, their value to the online grocer increases since they place orders more frequently. Second, the positive effect of M-shopping on subsequent purchase behavior is more pronounced on previously low-spenders who place larger orders on a more frequent basis after adopting Mshopping. In another similar quasi-experimental study using consumer-level transaction data, Huang et al.&nbsp;(2015) found that after mobile channel adoption, the purchases on the web channel were slightly cannibalized; however, the consumers’ purchase frequency and purchases increased overall, suggesting that the positive synergy effect of the new channel exceeded its cannibalization effect.</p>
<p><strong>Insight R3.2:</strong> Adding mobile app channel by multichannel retailer boosts customers’ purchase frequency, spending amount, and returns in both existing online and offline channels of the retailer and overall, with the impact being greater on offline-only customers than on onlineonly customers, in a less competitive mobile app market. The positive effect can reverse in a market with many competitors offering mobile apps.</p>
<p>Narang &amp; Shankar (2019) found, first, a complementary effect, i.e., app adopters’ purchases in both, the online and offline channels increase after app launch. Furthermore, app adopters buy 33% more frequently, 34% more items, and spend 37% more than non-adopters in the period after app introduction. At the same time, they return 35% more frequently, 35% more items, and 41% more in dollar value. Overall, app adopters spend 36% more in net monetary value.</p>
<p>Van Heerde, Dinner &amp; Neslin (2019) found that app access behavior of offline-only and online customers was similar across all metrics but generated more incremental sales among offline-only customers compared to online customers, especially among offline-only customers not located near the physical store. This finding supported their theory that distant and offline-only customers’ needs for convenient interaction or digital engagement are not being met in the absence of the app. In other words, the “value proposition” of retailer apps is to deliver convenient access to a superior digital engagement than that provided by visiting the retailer’s website directly.</p>

<section id="cross-channel-integration-cci-rq4" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cross-channel-integration-cci-rq4">Cross-channel integration (CCI) (RQ4)</h3>
<p>Cao &amp; Li (2015) define CCI as “the degree to which a firm coordinates the objectives, design, and deployment of its channels to create synergies for the firm and offer particular benefits to its consumers.”</p>
<p>Following Cao &amp; Li (2015, 2018), any or a combination of following elements contributes to CCI by a multichannel retailer: integrated marketing communications, i.e., consistent use of the same brand and messaging in all channels; integration of shoppers’ order fulfillment, e.g., ‘Click &amp; Collect’ options (see below), ‘Buy online and return in-store (BORS)’; integration of consumer information access, e.g., access to online inventory and online orders fulfilled by staff in-store, allowing online consumers to browse the inventory in-store, linkage between store and mobile app (WiFi in-store, locating store by mobile app). More comprehensive or ‘Full’ CCI would include alignment of all marketing mix elements in all channels, centralization of back-end systems, and organization transformation.</p>
<p><strong>Insight R4.1:</strong> In general, greater CCI by a multichannel retailer has a positive effect on customers’ purchase intention, purchase value, and loyalty to the retailer.</p>
<p>This perceived integration reduces the customer’s perception of risk associated with the potential unavailability of a desired product at a particular channel.</p>
<p>Swaid &amp; Wigand (2012) studied the impact of a specific type of CCI, specifically, offering customers the option of integrated-pickup (or ’buy online and pick up in-store ’, i.e., BOPS discussed in more depth below). They found that perceived online service quality or value is significantly influenced positively by integrated pick-up and in turn, has a positive impact on customer loyalty.</p>
<p>A third study bearing on the value of integrating website and physical store design by multichannel retailers by Emrich &amp; Verhoef (2015) found that a homogenous design (with cues corresponding to their physical stores) rather than a prototypical design (with channel-specific attributes) for the online shop creates a positive impact on intended customer patronage especially when the customers have had good shopping experience in physical stores and show high processing intensity.</p>
<p>Lastly, the study by Herhausen et al.&nbsp;(2015) investigated the indirect effect of online-offline ‘OI” integration, i.e., integrating access to and knowledge about the offline channel into an online channel, on consumers’ search intention, purchase intentions and willingness to pay. They found that integration increases all three because it is associated with a higher perceived service quality by the customer and a lower perception of risk. While the positive effect of integration on the perceived service quality of the online store is through a direct effect, the positive impact on overall willingness to purchase (WTP) is through an indirect effect.</p>
<p>In particular, offering a comparable product assortment in the online and offline store strongly improves the transfer of chain preferences and results in a higher likelihood for the consumer to choose the online alternative of a chain.</p>
<p><strong>Insight R4.2:</strong> In general, greater CCI by a multichannel retailer has a positive effect on overall retailer performance.</p>
<p>Cao &amp; Li (2015) found that CCI boosts sales growth for firms with less online experience, provided they can leverage their physical stores and existing distribution capabilities. Firms with larger physical store networks benefit less from coordination activities across channels.</p>
<p>Tagashira &amp; Minami (2019) performed a stochastic frontier analysis of publicly listed corporate-level data collected from Japanese multichannel retailers. They found that CCI, particularly a higher level of integrated marketing communications, is positively associated with the multichannel retailers’ cost efficiency, which in turn improves firm performance.</p>
<p>BOPS as a CCI strategy: BOPS functionality provides customers with real-time store-level product availability information, i.e., the retailer shows online viewers the locations at which the items are available, lets customers complete transactions online, and allows customers very soon thereafter to pick up the items in a store at their convenience (Gao and Su 2017). BOPS reduces shopping transaction costs for customers since items are picked and packed by store employees prior to customer pick-up. Last but not least, BOPS transactions are considered online revenue.</p>
<p>A C&amp;C option that is not materially different from BOPS from a consumer viewpoint is the ‘ship-to-store’ (STS) strategy. The main difference between them is from the retailer standpoint, i.e., BOPS uses in-store inventory to fulfill customer demand while STS uses centralized fulfillment and typically takes somewhat longer to fulfill (Akturk, Ketzenberg and Heim 2018).</p>
<p>Insight R4.3: Implementation of BOPS by non-grocery multichannel retailers has a positive effect on the retailer’s total revenues, i.e., any reduction in consumer spending online is made up by spending increases offline.</p>
<p>Gallino and Moreno observed that while online sales dropped around 7% after BOPS implementation, B&amp;M sales in stores increased by 6%, and given the much larger proportion of the latter sales in the retailer’s total sales, ultimately implied an average net increase of 4% of the total sales. In short, this study showed BOPS implementation results in lower online sales, higher store sales, and higher store traffic.</p>
<p>Akturk, Ketzenberg &amp; Heim (2018) found cross-channel customer returns of online purchases to physical stores increased while returns from store purchases were reduced. Detailed analysis of the data showed that high-value purchase customers switched from completing the online channel’s STS process to completing the purchase in the brick-and-mortar channel – and often bought even more expensive products in the process!</p>
<p><strong>Insight R4.4:</strong> BOPS and C&amp;C have positive effects on customer’s online and offline spending</p>
<p>Gallino &amp; Moreno (2014) also found a positive effect on online purchase amount and, in fact, reported that ultimately BOPS usage can simultaneously enhance offline and online spending (in their study, about an increase of $5 in monthly spending).</p>
<p>We speculate that the big difference between Gielens, Gisjsbrechts &amp; Geyskens (2021) conclusion about an increase in online channel spending as a result of C&amp;C versus the earlier studies we have reviewed is related to the differences in retail settings of the various research studies. Specifically, grocery purchases are much more regular, planned, and familiar than the purchase of durable goods or appliances. Hence, the timing of purchase, freshness of food and convenience in ordering and pick up are key needs for consumers to buy groceries. This mix of needs can be clearly satisfied to a great degree by C&amp;C options. In contrast, durable goods like furniture and jewelry are more ‘touch and feel’ and ‘try’ type products which could increase the temptation to channel-switch during usage of BOPS service by the retailer.</p>

<section id="multichannel-retailers-marketing-mix-strategies-rq5" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="multichannel-retailers-marketing-mix-strategies-rq5">Multichannel retailer’s marketing mix strategies (RQ5)</h3>
<p>In this section, we provide empirical insights (many are, however, findings from single studies) from the extant research on cross-channel impact of marketing mix (MM) strategies pertaining to variables such as price, product assortment, marketing communications (advertising, catalogs, emails), price promotion, returns and delivery policies.</p>
<p><strong>Insight R5.1:</strong> Customers of multichannel retailers are willing to pay a somewhat higher price for an item in the offline channel than its price in the online channel.</p>
<p>They found that customers are willing to accept at most 2% higher prices offline than online, for a broad range of products (in between very high-priced products or low-priced takeaway items, which seem to permit higher price premiums). Further investigation showed that customers’ heterogeneity moderates the willingness to accept an offline premium, i.e., some customer segments are resistant while others respond less negatively to higher offline prices. Lastly, consumers seem more tolerant of offline price premiums for unplanned purchases.</p>
<p><strong>Insight R5.2:</strong> Optimized product assortment offline has a positive effect on the total revenue of a retailer.</p>
<p>Using conjoint analysis in a lab experiment, they estimated that an optimized offline assortment increases the total revenue by up to 40%. Hence, offline assortment, which “showcases” the product attributes, impacts profits across both offline and online channels.</p>
<p><strong>Insight R5.3:</strong> Online advertising by a multichannel retailer can have strong effects on offline channel sales. Hence, measuring the impact of (online and/or offline) advertising on only a single channel by a multichannel retailer does not fully account for its total impact, i.e., cross-channel effects exist and must be accounted for in deciding resource allocations.</p>
<p>Dinner, Heerde Van &amp; Neslin (2014) expand on the work of Naik &amp; Peters (2009) by considering actual purchases, carryover effects, competitive effects, and endogeneity using sales data from a large US, multichannel clothing retailer. Specifically, they found: (i) positive cross-channel advertising effects that are almost as strong as own-channel effects; (ii) online advertising, and in particular search advertising, is more effective than traditional advertising in driving overall sales, primarily due to the strength of online to offline cross-channel effects; and (iii) while traditional advertising has a positive direct cross effect on online sales, it negatively (positively) impacts click-through rates (impressions) of paid search ads.</p>
<p><strong>Insight R5.4:</strong> Catalog mailings by a multichannel retailer can drive new customers’ choice of shopping in a noncatalog channel (web, store) of the retailer.</p>
<p><strong>Insight R5.5:</strong> Catalog mailings by a multichannel retailer can increase purchases in web and physical store channels.</p>
<p><strong>Insight R5.6:</strong> Emails induce migration of catalog consumers to the Internet and a higher online channel purchase frequency.</p>
<p>Mark et al.&nbsp;(2019, p.537), in their study of a multichannel online + offline + store retailer, found email communication (after controlling for catalogs, demographics, and seasonality) have a significant positive effect on the web channel use for all uncovered segments in their consumer-level study sample.</p>
<p><strong>Insight R5.7:</strong> Cross-channel effects of marketing efforts in a retailer’s channels with similar (dissimilar) primary influence roles are substitutional (complementary) and asymmetric.</p>
<p><strong>Insight R5.8:</strong> Price promotions in one channel of a multichannel grocery retailer can have negative and asymmetric effects on category purchases in the retailer’s other channel.</p>
<p>They find that (1) promotions in one channel can have negative effects on category purchases in the other channel during the promotion period, (2) similar to Shankar &amp; Kushwaha’s (2021) finding, these cross-channel effects are asymmetric, (3) high promotion frequency can have negative effects on future promotion effectiveness in the other channel, and (4) cross-channel effects are more negative for more loyal customers of the chain.</p>
<p><strong>Insight R5.9:</strong> Coupons that are redeemable across multiple channels have asymmetric cross-effects depending on the channel where the coupon is offered.</p>
<p><strong>Insight R5.10:</strong> Reduction in delivery time of online orders can lead to increases in both online store sales and offline store sales for a multichannel online+offline retailer.</p>
<p><strong>Insight R5.11:</strong> Returns period reduction may not affect online sales but can adversely affect offline store sales of a multichannel retailer.</p>
<p>They found that the RPP change does not have any statistically significant effect on sales and return rates for online stores, but it decreases offline sales by 8%, return rate by 2.7 percentage points, and profit by 7.3% per brick-and-mortar store, corresponding to a 2.7% decrease in annual sales for the retailer.</p>
<p>The decision of retailers to become omnichannel seems to be complicated further due to external forces that might influence the retailer’s channel strategies. As suggested in our framework (Fig. 1) – but still greatly under-researched - competition and technology are likely to moderate the crosschannel effects of the retailer’s strategies and hence, its decision to become omnichannel.</p>
<p>Another key insight from the literature is the positive effect of the mobile channel. We believe that retailers should rely more on this channel and improve it further. The mobile shopping experience will be bolstered by new and everevolving Artificial Intelligence tools, Machine Learning, Big Data, and the like.</p>
<p>Better AI algorithms for Inventory logistics and curbside pickup will help create a smoother shopping experience for customers.</p>
<p>With AI-enabled knowledge of customer’s previous purchases, a retailer will customize a product or service for the customer. Retargeting algorithms will reinforce learning. A personalized ad targeting engine will learn about each customer through various interactions, frequency &amp; time of order placement. The follow-up customized and curated advertisement will be delivered accordingly to ensure the maximum chance of customer making the purchase.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-4">Abstract</h2>
<p>Retailing is undergoing a remarkable transformation brought by recent advances in technology. In this paper, we provide a deep discussion of and look ahead on how technology is changing retail, starting with a classification of technologies that impact retailing, in particular, in the COVID-19 and beyond world. We discuss different theoretical frameworks or lenses to better understand the role of technology in retailing. We identify and elaborate on the drivers and outcomes of technology adoption by shoppers, retailers, employees, and suppliers. We speculate on future retail scenarios and outline future research avenues on technology and retailing. We close by concluding that technology is not only reshaping retailing, but also allowing retailing to pivot in the face of new and unforeseen circumstances.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="brief-3">Brief</h2>
<p>Applications of AI in retailing include personalization and recommendation systems, sales/customer relationship management, customer service management, supply chain optimization, inventory management, and store task creation.</p>
<p>The dramatic week-to-week or day-to-day changes in shopping trends during the pandemic’s outbreak mean that those with instant access to data would be better informed and make better investments than those using less current data.</p>
<p>While much research has examined how technologies such as pointof-sale, automated teller machine (ATM), and the Internet have changed retailing, not much is known about the impacts of emerging technologies such as micro-cloud computing, new robotics, fifth generation (5G) telecommunication, the Internet of Things (IoT), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) on retailing.</p>
<p>Many of the technologies are powered by artificial intelligence (AI). The integration of AI into these emerging technologies adds another layer of change to the retail ecosystem. There is a dearth of deep analyses and frameworks that enable a better understanding of the impact of these technologies on retailing. In this paper, we seek to close this gap in understanding of technologies’ impact on retailing. In the next section, we begin by presenting a classification of technologies that impact retailing. We then discuss different theoretical frameworks or lenses to better understand the role of technology in retailing. We follow it up by identifying and elaborating on the drivers and outcomes of technology adoption by shoppers, employees, suppliers, and retailers.1 In the subsequent section, we speculate on future retail scenarios and outline future research avenues on technology and retailing. We close with our conclusions on how technology is reshaping retailing.</p>

<p>Our operationalization of technology is focused on information and communication technologies, which are systems used for storing, retrieving, processing, and sending information. These systems require both hardware and software components.</p>
<p>On the demand side, these technologies create digitized services such as AI-enabled consumer choice assistance, recommendations, and ecommerce. They also help retailers build elivery capabilities such as buy online and pick up offline and develop support and payment competencies through automated customer service, digital payment service, and telemedicine service. Increasingly, these technologies are delivered through mobile devices and platforms that leverage the growing use of mobile technology by shoppers for purchase research, purchase execution, and order tracking.</p>
<p>From the supply chain standpoint, warehouse robots, scan drones, and scan robots are assisting humans. In some cases, these technologies are replacing humans, causing a wholesale repurposing of the roles they play within the supply chain. Some of the demand induced digitized services are also creating a strain on the delivery side of the supply chain due to the growing instant gratification needs of shoppers.</p>

<p>These technologies are used by customers/shoppers and facilitated by retailers to enhance customer engagement with products, services, or brands. Examples include mobile devices, wearables, smart speakers, AR, VR, and MR systems, chatbots, smart mirrors, and payment technologies. Shopper marketing research and practice suggest that such technologies have an important role to play along a shopper’s shopping journey. Retailer facilitation and value creation together with shopper adoption are critical to the success of these shopperfacing technologies.<br>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="categorize-technologies-by-information">Categorize Technologies by Information</h4>
<p>Another way to classify technologies in the retailing context is based on whether they are related to information or not. Accordingly, they can be classified as information technology (IT) versus non-IT. As outlined earlier, our primary focus is on information related technologies. Many of the IT based technologies are also communication technologies. IT based technologies have a large ecosystem and new technologies may have to fit into this system. Sometimes, retailers can combine IT and non-IT-based technologies to solve business problems.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract-5">Abstract</h2>
<p>The world of retailing is being reimagined and transformed at breakneck speeds due to new technologies, as well as due to changes in consumer purchasing behavior resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This dynamic retail marketplace is forcing retailers to strategize how to best position themselves to survive and flourish in this environment. Recognizing that we are at a critical inflection point in the world of retailing, we conceptualize a Strategic Wheel of Retailing in the new technology era that emphasizes technology as the core enabler of the strategies related to the 6Ps of retailing (retail place and supply chain management, product, pricing, promotion, personnel, and presentation). In particular, the articles calls for retailers to carefully their review their competitive ecosystem as they adapt to the new technologies, raises some issues, and offers new directions for further research on how technology can be leveraged to design profitable retail strategies.</p>
</section>
<section id="brief-4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="brief-4">Brief</h2>
<p>Expanded applications of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, virtual reality, big data, and mobile apps have all contributed to frontend offerings that impact the retail interface with customers, as well as back-end technologies that facilitate retail operations.</p>
<p>We conceptualize these strategy decisions around the 6Ps (retail place and supply chain management, product, pricing, promotion, personnel, and presentation) as the spokes of retailing and technology as the hub.</p>
<p>While new retail technologies encapsulate a wide range of technologies, many can be grouped under an AI umbrella. Due to the vast volumes of customer data available across formats (e.g., grocery, drug, warehouse), AI is a powerful tool which can draw from that data to inform retail decisions. Due to the insights and information AI can provide to retailers, some predict that AI will become a dominant force in the retail industry.</p>
<p>The many AI applications that are not customer-facing also can facilitate the retail experience, whether by managing supply chains, enhancing demand forecasting, or performing logistical and warehouse activities more efficiently.</p>
<section id="retail-place-supply-chain-management" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="retail-place-supply-chain-management">Retail Place &amp; Supply Chain Management</h3>
<p>Retail formats have continually evolved, from small, familyowned stores to vast department and general merchandise stores, as well as mass merchandisers, supercenters, convenience stores, and specialty stores. However, none of this evolution has been as disruptive as online channels facilitated by all the advancements in technology.</p>
<p>Across the board, the fundamental challenge has been finding a way to operate all channels in a seamless, synchronized fashion, and thereby transforming multichannel retailing strategies to a true omnichannel strategy that optimizes all customer touchpoints (Gauri et al.&nbsp;2021b).</p>
<p>The best retailers optimize value for shoppers by enhancing their customer experience while simultaneously reducing the frictions and inconvenience associated with shopping (e.g., Lululemon, Apple, Nike, Sephora, Target, Walmart, Kroger, Warby Parker). Together with this delineation of paths to success, Gauri et al.&nbsp;(2021a) shine light on different retail formats including hybrid formats that allow customers to buy online and receive delivery or pick up the merchandise curbside.</p>
</section>
<section id="retail-product" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="retail-product">Retail Product</h3>
<p>Key components of merchandising decisions involve both understanding the role of the retailer identity that the retailer conveys through its merchandise, as well as the fine balance between national brands and store/private label brands. Careful balance of the type of merchandise and assortment carried by the retailer is important for it to create meaningful relationships with their customers.</p>
<p>Retailers also need to leverage the data readily available to them, using their evolving analytics capabilities to develop a “smart private-label” strategy.</p>
<p>These advances support greater targeting of niche segments and more precise personalization. Retailers and their design teams thus gain new insights into the needs of different segments, which has prompted them to offer a wider variety of brands (national and private label).</p>
</section>
<section id="retail-pricing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="retail-pricing">Retail Pricing</h3>
<p>Pricing research generally explores the ways price information is communicated to consumers, as well as the effects of price and other types of promotions on consumer behavior. The list of potentially affected behaviors is extensive, including (but not limited to) purchases, brand switching, and complementary product purchases.</p>
<p>AI-powered information that retailers can extract from their existing data (Guha et al.&nbsp;2021) will be integral in their future pricing strategies.</p>

<p>Villanova et al.&nbsp;(2021) consider key opportunities for retailers as the customers move through their shopping journey. This includes thinking strategically about when what, and where to communicate in their messaging to customers.</p>
<p>Some key areas of advancement in offering retailer promotions to consumers have been facilitated by technology, such as online offers, mobile offers and in-store offers. At the same time, retailers must incorporate privacy and data restrictions into their strategizing about promotions.</p>
<p>How can retailers enhance sales using a variety of in-store (e.g., digital displays, kiosks, robots) and online (e.g., bots, personalized content) technology? In this environment, does the type of product (e.g., utilitarian vs.&nbsp;hedonic) influence the effectiveness of promotional and communication strategies?</p>

<section id="retail-personnel" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="retail-personnel">Retail Personnel</h3>
<p>For the more personal interactions where the frontline worker should be familiar with the customer, retailers still benefit from customer relationship management systems that collect and store information about the customer. However, even some of those interactions are being done by AI-based bots which assist customers on their websites, reduce frictions and online shopping cart abandonment, and increase conversions.</p>
<p>How should retailers encourage customer engagement, in an environment where retail associates need to maintain social distance? Can technology augment retail associates’ efforts to interact with customers?</p>

<section id="retail-presentation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="retail-presentation">Retail Presentation</h3>
<p>The physical atmosphere (or sensory elements) of the retail store and the appearance of the online retail website has important influences on consumer shopping behavior (Biswas 2019). Roggeveen, Grewal and Schweiger (2020) showcase four central factors: design, ambience, social, and trialability.</p>
<p>In this new technology era, the pace of change in retailing has been accelerating rapidly. Various technologies (AI, machine learning, big data analytics, automation, augmented reality, robotics etc.) have become essential elements that impact key strategic decision areas of retailing. Using the Strategic Wheel of Retailing as our framework, we discuss key areas of strategic decision making for retailers, including technology, retail place and supply chain management, product, pricing, promotion, presentation, and personnel. In addition, we offer suggestions for future research in each of these areas. The insights provided by this article reveal that every retailer should review its competitive eco-system, while also looking inward to use technology as a key enabler. In addition, researchers can take inspiration from the research directions and issues raised in this paper.</p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>This research presents the use of machine learning analytics and metrics in the retailing context. We first discuss what is machine learning and explain the field’s origins. We then demonstrate the strengths of machine learning methods using an online retailing dataset, noting key areas of divergence from the traditional explanatory approach to data analysis. We then provide a review of the current state of machine learning in top-level retailing and marketing research, integrating ideas for future research and showcasing potential applications for practitioners. We propose that the explanatory and machine learning approaches need not be mutually exclusive. Particularly, we discuss four key areas in the general scientific research process that can benefit from machine learning: data exploration/theory building, variable creation, estimation, and predicting an outcome metric. Due to the customer-facing nature of retailing, we anticipate several challenges researchers and practitioners might face in the adoption and implementation of machine learning, such as ethical prediction and customer privacy issues. Overall, our belief is that machine learning can enhance customer experience and, accordingly, we advance opportunities for future research.</p>
<section id="brief-5" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="brief-5">Brief</h2>
<p>Stéphane Bérubé, the chief marketing officer (CMO) of L’Oréal in Western Europe, suggests that rather than the technology being the largest hurdle, “the tough part [of AI] is finding the purpose” (Ives 2018). Industry reports suggest retailers have yet to fully realize their returns from investments in analytics (McKinsey Global Institute 2017).</p>
<p>AI is “defined as a system’s ability to interpret external data correctly, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation” (Haenlein and Kaplan 2019). AI branches out into closely related fields of computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and machine learning.</p>
<p>ML consists of “methods or algorithms designed to learn the underlying patterns in the data and make predictions based on these patterns” (Dzyabura and Yoganarasimhan 2018). Specifically, learning is through a training experience with respect to some task, and success is judged using some performance metric.</p>
<p>We illustrate these concepts in the retailing context by examining the substantive question: “can researchers effectively predict the prices of products carried by online retailers?” Doing so can provide retail managers suggestions for new products, and assist in pricing and promotional decisions. We use the Amazon tablet computer dataset made available by Wang, Mai, and Chiang (2014). We match product attributes, market price dynamics, and customer reviews to obtain 2,376 observations for 438 tablet computers at the weekly level. Our variables of interest are in Table 1.</p>
<p>For example, a manager may wish to “listen in” to what customers are discussing in their online reviews, exploring the data to obtain useful insights. Manually reading thousands of customer reviews can be expensive and time consuming. Also, having humans read and judge the reviews may introduce inconsistencies and biases in the coding. Unsupervised algorithms, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), can provide an efficient solution by summarizing text data into a set of humaninterpretable topics (Bendle and Wang 2016). We apply LDA to our data of 37,562 tablet reviews and present the representative words of the uncovered eight topics in Fig. 2.</p>
<p>Categories of ML that have recently received attention from marketing researchers are semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. Semi-supervised learning combines elements from supervised and unsupervised learning and is often used where labeling the training data is expensive. It might well be the form of ML most used in retail. Semi-supervised algorithms are trained using both labeled and unlabeled data; the smaller set of labeled data is used to map the larger set of unlabeled data to labels.</p>
<p>Reinforcement learning involves an “agent” selecting and performing actions, often by trial and error at first, in return for rewards. The agent’s objective is to learn the best strategy (called a policy), which is defined as the one that earns the greatest reward over time. An agent learns to balance exploration (testing new actions) and exploitation (gaining known rewards). An example in retailing that can utilize reinforcement learning is customer engagement. By specifying clicks as a reward for an agent that determines which advertisement to display, reinforcement learning can learn to present the optimal advertisements that maximize consumer engagement over time.</p>
<p>When conducting data analysis we conceptualize an explanatory approach as one focused on the testing of hypotheses, the formulation of which is driven by either intuition or causal theory (Shmueli 2010).</p>
<p>In this section, we outline the current state of ML in retailing and marketing research. We categorized articles on a customer experience journey – Awareness, Consideration, Purchase, Retention, and Advocacy (Coston 2016). Many papers can contribute at several stages but we simplify to show how ML could help solve major challenges for retailers (Table 3).</p>
<section id="awareness" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="awareness">Awareness</h3>
<p>A major challenge is “how can retailers make consumers aware of what they are offering?” Promotional activities using insights from ML can better attract customers. ML research is especially strong in market structure analysis. The abundance of user-generated content (UGC), such as customer reviews on websites and tags on social media platforms, allows retailers to conduct market structure analysis, which is an efficient alternative to the traditional methods of focus groups and surveys.</p>
</section>
<section id="consideration" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="consideration">Consideration</h3>
<p>Chen, Nelson, and Hsu (2015) combine ML techniques with neuroimaging data to predict what brand people think about. Timoshenko and Hauser (2019) use deep learning to identify emerging customer needs from reviews. Topic modelling can also help us understand customer needs (Trusov, Ma, and Jamal 2016).</p>
<p>Conjoint has seen a stream of ML research (Chen et al.&nbsp;2017; Dzyabura and Hauser 2011; Evgeniou, Boussios, and Zacharia 2005; Evgeniou, Pontil, and Toubia 2007; Hauser et al.&nbsp;2010; Huang and Luo 2016). The ability to cope with nonlinear relationships is an important strength of ML (Cui and Curry 2005).</p>
</section>
<section id="purchase-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="purchase-1">Purchase</h3>
<p>Retailers can use virtual reality, showrooming, or photobooths to create a dynamic, stimulating experience for shoppers. ML can even identify what is selling in real-time to help keep popular SKUs in inventory. For example, Liu, Singh, and Srinivasan (2016) combine cloud computing, ML, and text mining to illustrate how online platform content may be used for more effective forecasting. The impact of ML at the purchase stage is most notable for online retailing, where customers can receive recommendations or discounts based on items in their baskets. While identifying missing, or complementary items, can increase retail revenues. Recommendations being a great strength of ML (Ansari, Li, and Zhang 2018). Marchand and Marx (2020) even provide reasons for the recommendations which is vital for human-interpretable insights.</p>
</section>
<section id="retention" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="retention">Retention</h3>
<p>ML can help at the post-purchase stage covering such interactions as item returns and service requests, mostly retention but might include other post-purchase customer analysis. Delivering effective service, which includes additional product recommendations, can use ML driven insights.</p>
</section>
<section id="advocacy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="advocacy">Advocacy</h3>
<p>Retailers need to better understand, and ideally influence, what is being said about them. How they can do this is another major retailing challenge, this time at the Advocacy stage. Tirunillai and Tellis (2014) use a supervised extension of LDA with customer reviews and have other work investigating chatter (Tirunillai and Tellis 2012, 2017). Homburg, Ehm, and Artz (2015) develop a community matched measure of consumer sentiment by analyzing consumer posts from online forums. Zhang and Godes (2018) analyze the impact of online opinions on consumers’ decision quality. Finally, Ordenes et al.&nbsp;(2019) text mine Facebook posts and Twitter tweets to demonstrate the impact of message intentions on message sharing.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="market-share">Market Share</h4>
<p>A better understanding of retail market structure and competitor identification can be driven by algorithms that create consumer choice sets. Yet if a market can be partitioned as a myriad of sub markets, even by each individual, what use is overall market share?</p>

<section id="sales-prediction" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sales-prediction">Sales Prediction</h4>
<p>There will be no obvious paper trail and plenty of choices, by humans and machines, to create such predictions. This leads to the concern that (a) the predicted sales will vary considerably between different creators, and (b) that the numbers may be cherry picked.</p>
<p><strong>RQ8:</strong> How can managers, observers, even auditors, best use ML sales predictions?</p>
</section>
<section id="logistics" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="logistics">Logistics</h4>
<p>Retail is a complex business where context matters to delivering effective results (Kumar, Sunder, and Sharma 2015), which suggests ML could be especially valuable.</p>
<p>ML prediction using the vast amount of data and processing power should help optimize inventory levels not just at the store level but across the entire system to ensure inventory is available.</p>
<p>Metrics can put a dollar amount on the value of limiting both out-of-stocks and excess inventory. Further, metrics grasping the multi- and omni-channel nature of modern retail will be invaluable. Indeed, attribution modeling should become more sophisticated. Can we create widely accepted measures of the value of showrooming and webrooming?</p>
<p><strong>RQ9:</strong> How can ML help improve retail supply chain logistics and put a dollar value on such improvements?</p>
</section>
<section id="customer-lifetime-value-clv" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="customer-lifetime-value-clv">Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)</h4>
<p>ML will assist in CLV being used at an increasingly disaggregated level. (Cohort-based CLV, though often a reasonable response, is always a second best as such approaches overvalue some customers and under value others).</p>
<p>ML offers the opportunity to give greater specificity to the idea of the firm as a collection of customer relationships (plus other assets).</p>
<p>CLV is a valuable predictive measure for managerial action, e.g., it informs acquisition and retention decisions, which fits well with ML strengths.</p>
<p>Using ML, CLV predictions are likely to be easiest for online retailers, given they can record all customer touchpoints. Still, store point-of- sale systems and customer systems can flash messages and offers to re-engage a customer predicted to be drifting away. In essence, ML will allow for greater use of valuable CLV methods.</p>
<p><strong>RQ10:</strong> What are the most promising ways to use ML to make CLV a usable metric in every situation?</p>

<p>To answer our research questions, we draw on an in-depth longitudinal case study conducted within the French on-line eyewear retailer Direct Optic from January 2013 to March 2015. From an ethnographic perspective, we document the evolution of the retailing company’s decisions and processes as they moved towards defining and implementing an omni-channel strategy. Research was carried out using primary (1500+ hours of participant observation and 118 interviews) and secondary data sources. A conceptualizing content analysis was conducted both manually and with NVivo software.</p>
</section>
<section id="findings" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="findings">Findings</h3>
<p>First, our results show that the challenges faced in shifting to omni-channel strategy are so numerous and so engaging that, de facto, it is impossible to evolve directly from a multi-channel, siloed strategy to an omni-channel strategy without any transition. Second, throughout this transformative process, our result show that the challenges faced by the company evolved gradually in terms of scope and priority, and can be categorized into two main categories: the strategy-related challenges (organizational, cultural, managerial, marketing and resources) which were the highest priority in the first stage and the development-related challenges (retailing mix, information systems and CRM) which became the highest priority during the second stage.</p>

However, AI often disrupts employees’ ways of working causing them to resist change, thus threatening the successful embedding and sustained usage of the technology. Using a longitudinal, multi-site ethnographic approach combining 74 stakeholder interviews and 14 on-site retail observations over a 5-year period, this article examines how employees’ practices change when retailers invest in AI. Practice co-evolution is identified as the process that undergirds successful AI integration and enables retail employees’ sustained usage of AI. Unlike product or practice diffusion, which may be organic or fortuitous, practice co-evolution is an orchestrated, collaborative process in which a practice is co-envisioned, co-adapted, and co-(re)aligned.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="brief-6">Brief</h2>
<p>In retail, AI applications are increasingly used to augment customer experiences (e.g., smart mirrors, augmented reality phone apps, metaverse adventures) and the efficiency of retail operations (e.g., self-service checkouts, employee handheld devices, smart inventory systems) To be sustained, practice co-evolution must be recursive and enabled via intentional knowledge transfers. This empiricallyderived recursive phasic model provides a roadmap for successful retail AI embedding, and fruitful future research avenues.</p>
<p>Reflecting the growing importance of AI investments, this article investigates the conditions that enable retailers to successfully embed AI and their employees’ sustained usage of the technology in the long run.</p>
<p>Building on theories of practice originating from Bourdieu (1977) and Garfinkel and Sacks (1970) that situate mundane activities as important social acts, this article takes retail practices as the units of analysis, critically interrogating practice change caused by AI investments within formal organizations.</p>
<p>The article utilizes practice theories to reveal how practice participants (those who perform a practice, such as store employees) and practice champions (those who intentionally disseminate a practice, such as senior executives, local retail managers, and trainers; Dilling et al., 2013) introduce AI into the retail environment and foster its effective, long-term usage by embedding it into existing ways of working.</p>
<p>This article shows that employee responses to the introduction of AI (e.g., inertia, misperceived enablement, efforts to use AI adroitly) are dependent on employees’ collaborative efforts to change existing practices and shape new ones.</p>
<p>Addressing this gap, this article reveals an orchestrated, collaborative, multi-stakeholder process that allows for intentional sustained practice change. The data reveal that practice co-evolution occurs in three phases consisting of co-envisioning how the proposed practice modification achieves organizational goals, co-adapting the co-envisioned practice to suit local retail conditions or context, and co-(re)aligning the co-adapted practice to ensure that organizational goals are achieved. The data further indicate that practice co-evolution is recursive as co-(re) aligned practices often become newly co-envisioned practices. Retail practice co-evolution should thus be viewed as a collaborative process to ensure that AI investments produce organizational benefits as employees become active partners in modifying their routines.</p>
<p>Second, at the practice participant level, this article identifies a mechanism that facilitates practice co-evolution termed here as practice enablement. Practice enablement is the result of intentional transfers and acquisitions of core (i.e., know-what, know-how, and know-why) and contextual (i.e., know-where, know-who, know-when) knowledge among practice participants that allow changes in the meanings, competences, or materialities (i.e., practice elements) of routines. While the extant practice literature broadly identifies practices as the site of organizational knowing (e.g., Nicolini, 2011), it remains silent about the mechanisms through which knowledge is embedded in a practice and transferred between participants. This research shows, for the first time, how these knowledge transfers unfold into organizational practices, leading to practice enablement. Our data show that retail employees’ practices are disrupted by the initial AI embedding, as the materialities of their work are modified, thus requiring the acquisition of new competences through knowledge transfer that is supported by the reframing of practice meanings. Moreover, retail employees are more willing to accept AI if it is introduced as a method of simplifying their workflow, reducing menial tasks, or enhancing job satisfaction. Findings further demonstrate that practice enablement can foster the successful and sustained use of AI among employees, which leads to the practice spreading to other employees.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) will substantially impact retailing. Building on past research and from interviews with senior managers, we examine how senior retailing managers should think about adopting AI, involving factors such as the extent to which an AI application is customer-facing, the amount of value creation, whether the AI application is online, and extent of ethics concerns. In addition, we highlight that the near-term impact of AI on retailing may not be as pronounced as the popular press might suggest, and also that AI is likely to be more effective if it focuses on augmenting (rather than replacing) managers’ judgments. Finally, while press coverage typically involves customer-facing AI applications, we highlight that a lot of value can be obtained by adopting non-customer-facing applications. Overall, we remain very optimistic as regards the impact of AI on retailing. Finally, we lay out a research agenda and also outline implications for practice.</p>

<section id="brief-7" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="brief-7">Brief</h2>
<p>Very broadly speaking, retailers like (say) Home Depot can increase their profits in one (or more) of three ways. That is, retailers can increase in-store sales, and/ or increase online sales, and/ or improve the efficiency of their supply chain. As such, many retailers are excited about artificial intelligence (AI), which offers the promise to (i) increase in-store sales, (ii) increase online sales and increase potential cross-sell/ upsell, and (iii) improve supply chain efficiency, improve in-store operations and make payments more efficient. The above point comports with Shankar (2018), who indicates that AI helps by (i) making omnichannel and mobile shopping more profitable, notably by sharpening personalized recommendations (ii) managing better the in-store experience, (iii) improving payments, customer service and CRM, and (iv) improving logistics and inventory optimization.</p>
<p>The influence of AI on retailing is projected to be substantial (Grewal, Roggeveen, and Nordfält 2017), for various reasons. First, retailing inherently involves contact with numerous customers, leading to the availability of customer transaction and attribution data. Second, these first-party data can be augmented with second-party data from external sources (e.g., rebate data from CPG firms partnering with the retailer) and/ or third-party data (e.g., social media or reports by data brokers such as Acxiom). When AI is used to analyze such data, it can deliver real-time and personalized recommendations, both of which are significant value drivers for retailing.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, Morgan (2018) indicates that “AI… greatest impact could be felt across the supply chain. From anticipating orders to managing deliveries, AI has the power to drastically increase efficiency in all areas of the supply chain… .”</p>
<p>Noting that ANI is likely to reflect the short term (or even the medium term) of the state of AI, we propose that retailers should look to AI applications to augment (rather than replace human capabilities. For example, a version of vee | 24’s ‘assistance bots’ works with (human) service agents to respond to incoming customer service requests. These bots then assist service agents in various ways, e.g.&nbsp;(i) by analyzing a customer’s tone, and so providing the service agent greater insight into the customer interaction, (ii) by providing the service agents a suitably scripted response, which the agent can use as-is, or with modifications, and (iii) by allowing the service agent to handle a higher caseload. In effect, vee | 24’s AI augments the service agent’s capabilities. This example makes two points, highlighting (i) balancing AI and human input and (ii) that even ANI can lead to significant value.</p>
<section id="a-farmework-for-ai-adoption" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-farmework-for-ai-adoption">A Farmework for AI Adoption</h3>
<p>Given what we know about the state of AI, we now outline a framework for how retailers may develop a suitable AI strategy and think about adopting AI. The primary factor that we consider is the extent to which an AI application is ‘customer-facing.’ This paper builds on the work of Shankar (2018), which outlines two main ways in which AI can impact retailing: (i) demand-side applications (e.g., personalization/ recommendation systems, customer relationship management, in-store customer experience management, payment management), and (ii) supply-side applications (e.g., inventory optimization, logistics, store payout optimization).</p>
<p>As the examples above show, the customer-facing determination is not dichotomous but instead reflects a continuum, with AI applications differing in the extent to which they are customer-facing. At one end of the continuum, nudging bots are very substantially customer-facing as they interact directly with the customer. At the other end of the continuum, non-customer facing AI applications do not interact much (or at all) with customers, as in the example of the Tally robot or Carrefour’s SAS Viya. In between are AI applications like assistance bots that listen to customer conversations but do not directly interact with customers.</p>
<p>How may retailers choose to adopt AI applications? Based on our discussions with senior managers, we argue that retailers choose to balance risk and return.</p>
<p>Customer journey management is one of the most central aspects of moving consumers from awareness to conversion, as well as getting them to consider different merchandise and service options (Grewal and Roggeveen 2020; Puccinelli et al.&nbsp;2009; Grewal, Levy, and Kumar, 2009), therefore, such AI-powered nudge bots can be invaluable.</p>
<p>Note here that the risk associated with nudging bots is higher, as any glitch directly (and negatively) impacts customers. Therefore, consistent with sentiments expressed by various senior managers we interviewed (Table 2, interviews #1, #3, and #5), as the first element of our framework, we predict that retailers are more likely to adopt non-customer-facing AI applications (versus customerfacing AI applications).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-variables-that-are-likely-to-moderate-this-relationship">Key variables that are likely to moderate this relationship</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Application value<br>
To the extent that a customerfacing application offers the promise of exceptional value, it may be adopted relatively sooner, despite the risks involved. We predict that the adoption of AI applications is moderated by the AI application’s value potential. Retailers are more likely to adopt non-customer-facing AI applications (versus customerfacing AI applications), but less so when the AI application has substantial value potential.</p></li>
<li><p>Online versus in-store<br>
Within the category of customer-facing AI applications, adoption by retailers will depend on their online/in-store status. Retailers are more likely to adopt ‘online setting’ AI applications because they know that online customers have fewer privacy concerns, and perceive AI applications as less intrusive into the sales process.</p></li>
<li><p>Ethics<br>
Ethics is a complex construct involving several subconstructs (sub-issues). The first dimension relates to customer safety, and specifically, data privacy. A second dimension relates to the potential for bias. A third dimension is linked to the appropriateness of the application.</p></li>

<p>Drawing on McKinsey Global Institute research and the applied experience with AI of McKinsey Analytics, we assess both the practical applications and the economic potential of advanced AI techniques across industries and business functions. Our findings highlight the substantial potential of applying deep learning techniques to use cases across the economy, but we also see some continuing limitations and obstacles—along with future opportunities as the technologies continue their advance.</p>
<p>It is important to highlight that, even as we see economic potential in the use of AI techniques, the use of data must always take into account concerns including data security, privacy, and potential issues of bias.</p>
<p>In a business setting, these analytic techniques can be applied to solve real-life problems. The most prevalent problem types are classification, continuous estimation and clustering.</p>
<p>Consumer industries such as retail and high tech will tend to see more potential from marketing and sales AI applications because frequent and digital interactions between business and customers generate larger data sets for AI techniques to tap into. E-commerce platforms, in particular, stand to benefit. This is because of the ease with which these platforms collect customer information such as click data or time spent on a web page and can then customize promotions, prices, and products for each customer dynamically and in real time.</p>
<p>In retail, marketing and sales is the area with the most significant potential value from AI, and within that function, pricing and promotion and customer service management are the main value areas. Our use cases show that using customer data to personalize promotions, for example, including tailoring individual offers every day, can lead to a one to two percent increase in incremental sales for brick-and-mortar retailers alone.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence’s impact is likely to be most substantial in marketing and sales as well as supply-chain management and manufacturing, based on our use cases.</p>

<h1>The economic potential of generative AI <span class="citation" data-cites="McKinsey2023">(<a href="#ref-McKinsey2023" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“Economic Potential of Generative AI | McKinsey”</span> NaN</a>)</span></h1>
<p>Generative AI applications such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Stable Diffusion, and others have captured the imagination of people around the world in a way AlphaGo did not, thanks to their broad utility—almost anyone can use them to communicate and create—and preternatural ability to have a conversation with a user. The latest generative AI applications can perform a range of routine tasks, such as the reorganization and classification of data. But it is their ability to write text, compose music, and create digital art that has garnered headlines and persuaded consumers and households to experiment on their own. As a result, a broader set of stakeholders are grappling with generative AI’s impact on business and society but without much context to help them make sense of it.</p>
<p>The speed at which generative AI technology is developing isn’t making this task any easier. ChatGPT was released in November 2022. Four months later, OpenAI released a new large language model, or LLM, called GPT-4 with markedly improved capabilities.1 Similarly, by May 2023, Anthropic’s generative AI, Claude, was able to process 100,000 tokens of text, equal to about 75,000 words in a minute—the length of the average novel—compared with roughly 9,000 tokens when it was introduced in March 2023.2 And in May 2023, Google announced several new features powered by generative AI, including Search Generative Experience and a new LLM called PaLM 2 that will power its Bard chatbot, among other Google products.</p>
<p>Foundation models are part of what is called deep learning, a term that alludes to the many deep layers within neural networks. Deep learning has powered many of the recent advances in AI, but the foundation models powering generative AI applications are a step-change evolution within deep learning. Unlike previous deep learning models, they can process extremely large and varied sets of unstructured data and perform more than one task.</p>
<p>AI trained on these models can perform several functions; it can classify, edit, summarize, answer questions, and draft new content, among other tasks.</p>
<p>It suggests that generative AI is poised to transform roles and boost performance across functions such as sales and marketing, customer operations, and software development. In the process, it could unlock trillions of dollars in value across sectors from banking to life sciences. The following sections share our initial findings.</p>
<p>Our latest research estimates that generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across the 63 use cases we analyzed—by comparison, the United Kingdom’s entire GDP in 2021 was $3.1 trillion. This would increase the impact of all artificial intelligence by 15 to 40 percent. This estimate would roughly double if we include the impact of embedding generative AI into software that is currently used for other tasks beyond those use cases.</p>
<p><strong>About 75 percent of the value that generative AI use cases could deliver falls across four areas: Customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and R&amp;D.</strong> Across 16 business functions, we examined 63 use cases in which the technology can address specific business challenges in ways that produce one or more measurable outcomes. Examples include generative AI’s ability to support interactions with customers, generate creative content for marketing and sales, and draft computer code based on natural-language prompts, among many other tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Generative AI will have a significant impact across all industry sectors.</strong> In retail and consumer packaged goods, the potential impact is also significant at $400 billion to $660 billion a year.</p>
<p><strong>Generative AI has the potential to change the anatomy of work, augmenting the capabilities of individual workers by automating some of their individual activities.</strong></p>
<p>Notably, the potential value of using generative AI for several functions that were prominent in our previous sizing of AI use cases, including manufacturing and supply chain functions, is now much lower. This is largely explained by the nature of generative AI use cases, which exclude most of the numerical and optimization applications that were the main value drivers for previous applications of AI.</p>
<p>In 2012, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) estimated that knowledge workers spent about a fifth of their time, or one day each work week, searching for and gathering information. If generative AI could take on such tasks, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the workers doing them, the benefits would be huge.</p>
<p>Its ability to rapidly digest mountains of data and draw conclusions from it enables the technology to offer insights and options that can dramatically enhance knowledge work. This can significantly speed up the process of developing a product and allow employees to devote more time to higher-impact tasks.</p>
<p>Following are four examples of how generative AI could produce operational benefits in a handful of use cases across the business functions that could deliver a majority of the potential value we identified in our analysis of 63 generative AI use cases. In the first two examples, it serves as a virtual expert, while in the following two, it lends a hand as a virtual collaborator.</p>
<p>1- Customer operations: Improving customer and agent experiences</p>
<p>Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the entire customer operations function, improving the customer experience and agent productivity through digital self-service and enhancing and augmenting agent skills. The technology has already gained traction in customer service because of its ability to automate interactions with customers using natural language. Research found that at one company with 5,000 customer service agents, the application of generative AI increased issue resolution by 14 percent an hour and reduced the time spent handling an issue by 9 percent.1 It also reduced agent attrition and requests to speak to a manager by 25 percent. Crucially, productivity and quality of service improved most among less-experienced agents, while the AI assistant did not increase—and sometimes decreased—the productivity and quality metrics of more highly skilled agents. This is because AI assistance helped less-experienced agents communicate using techniques similar to those of their higher-skilled counterparts.</p>
<p><strong>Customer self-service</strong> Generative AI–fueled chatbots can give immediate and personalized responses to complex customer inquiries regardless of the language or location of the customer. We estimate that generative AI could further reduce the volume of human-serviced contacts by up to 50 percent, depending on a company’s existing level of automation.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution during initial contact</strong> Generative AI can instantly retrieve data a company has on a specific customer, which can help a human customer service representative more successfully answer questions and resolve issues during an initial interaction.</p>
<p><strong>Reduced response time</strong> Generative AI can cut the time a human sales representative spends responding to a customer by providing assistance in real time and recommending next steps.</p>
<p><strong>Increased sales</strong> Because of its ability to rapidly process data on customers and their browsing histories, the technology can identify product suggestions and deals tailored to customer preferences. Additionally, generative AI can enhance quality assurance and coaching by gathering insights from customer conversations, determining what could be done better, and coaching agents.</p>
<p>We estimate that applying generative AI to customer care functions could increase productivity at a value ranging from 30 to 45 percent of current function costs.</p>
<p>2- Marketing and sales: Boosting personalization, content creation, and sales productivity</p>
<p>Generative AI has taken hold rapidly in marketing and sales functions, in which text-based communications and personalization at scale are driving forces. The technology can create personalized messages tailored to individual customer interests, preferences, and behaviors, as well as do tasks such as producing first drafts of brand advertising, headlines, slogans, social media posts, and product descriptions. Introducing generative AI to marketing functions requires careful consideration. For one thing, mathematical models trained on publicly available data without sufficient safeguards against plagiarism, copyright violations, and branding recognition risks infringing on intellectual property rights. A virtual try-on application may produce biased representations of certain demographics because of limited or biased training data. Thus, significant human oversight is required for conceptual and strategic thinking specific to each company’s needs.</p>
<p>Potential operational benefits from using generative AI for marketing include the following:</p>
<p><strong>Efficient and effective content creation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Enhanced use of data</strong></p>
<p><strong>SEO optimization</strong></p>
<p><strong>Product discovery and search personalization</strong> With generative AI, product discovery and search can be personalized with multimodal inputs from text, images, and speech, and a deep understanding of customer profiles. For example, technology can leverage individual user preferences, behavior, and purchase history to help customers discover the most relevant products and generate personalized product descriptions. This would allow CPG, travel, and retail companies to improve their e-commerce sales by achieving higher website conversion rates.</p>
<p>For example, our analysis estimates generative AI could contribute roughly $310 billion in additional value for the retail industry (including auto dealerships) by boosting performance in functions such as marketing and customer interactions.</p>
<p>The technology could generate value for the retail and consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry by increasing productivity by 1.2 to 2.0 percent of annual revenues, or an additional $400 billion to $660 billion.1 To streamline processes, generative AI could automate key functions such as customer service, marketing and sales, and inventory and supply chain management. Technology has played an essential role in the retail and CPG industries for decades. Traditional AI and advanced analytics solutions have helped companies manage vast pools of data across large numbers of SKUs, expansive supply chain and warehousing networks, and complex product categories such as consumables. In addition, the industries are heavily customer facing, which offers opportunities for generative AI to complement previously existing artificial intelligence. For example, generative AI’s ability to personalize offerings could optimize marketing and sales activities already handled by existing AI solutions. Similarly, generative AI tools excel at data management and could support existing AI-driven pricing tools. Applying generative AI to such activities could be a step toward integrating applications across a full enterprise.</p>

<p>Consumers increasingly seek customization in everything from clothing and cosmetics to curated shopping experiences, personalized outreach, and food—and generative AI can improve that experience. Generative AI can aggregate market data to test concepts, ideas, and models. Stitch Fix, which uses algorithms to suggest style choices to its customers, has experimented with DALL·E to visualize products based on customer preferences regarding color, fabric, and style. Using text-to-image generation, the company’s stylists can visualize an article of clothing based on a consumer’s preferences and then identify a similar article among Stitch Fix’s inventory.</p>
<p>Retailers can create applications that give shoppers a next-generation experience, creating a significant competitive advantage in an era when customers expect to have a single natural-language interface help them select products. For example, generative AI can improve the process of choosing and ordering ingredients for a meal or preparing food—imagine a chatbot that could pull up the most popular tips from the comments attached to a recipe. There is also a big opportunity to enhance customer value management by delivering personalized marketing campaigns through a chatbot. Such applications can have human-like conversations about products in ways that can increase customer satisfaction, traffic, and brand loyalty. Generative AI offers retailers and CPG companies many opportunities to cross-sell and upsell, collect insights to improve product offerings, and increase their customer base, revenue opportunities, and overall marketing ROI.</p>

<p>The growth of e-commerce also elevates the importance of effective consumer interactions. Retailers can combine existing AI tools with generative AI to enhance the capabilities of chatbots, enabling them to better mimic the interaction style of human agents—for example, by responding directly to a customer’s query, tracking or canceling an order, offering discounts, and upselling. Automating repetitive tasks allows human agents to devote more time to handling complicated customer problems and obtaining contextual information.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="factors-for-retail-and-cpg-organizations-to-consider">Factors for retail and CPG organizations to consider</h2>
<p>As retail and CPG executives explore how to integrate generative AI in their operations, they should keep in mind several factors that could affect their ability to capture value from the technology:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>External inference. Generative AI has increased the need to understand whether generated content is based on fact or inference, requiring a new level of quality control.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Adversarial attacks. Foundation models are a prime target for attack by hackers and other bad actors, increasing the variety of potential security vulnerabilities and privacy risks.&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To address these concerns, retail and CPG companies will need to strategically keep humans in the loop and ensure security and privacy are top considerations for any implementation. Companies will need to institute new quality checks for processes previously handled by humans, such as emails written by customer reps, and perform more-detailed quality checks on AI-assisted processes such as product design.</p>

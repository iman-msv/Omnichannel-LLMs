# Omnichannel-LLMs
Our proposal is that omnichannel retailing can be effectively implemented using Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their capabilities in creating content in various formats that align with channel requirements. This means that customers can interact with the LLM throughout their purchase journey, providing consistent touchpoints. Moreover, previous studies have shown that LLMs can simulate and act like an economic agent. It is possible to use a new LLM to simulate a customer with specific characteristics and compare the level of satisfaction after sending LLM-generated messages.

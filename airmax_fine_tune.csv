2,Felt different at first then it alleviate some pain in my knees after work out.,positive
3,Better than expected!,positive
4,"Still one of the best Nike running shoes with good cushion, shock absorbing hells, much better than the later models with flimsy uppers and thin plastic sides. I still get the 2017 and 2016 Sir Max model wherever I can!",positive
5,Bought for daily use and these work great.,positive
6,The image in the Amazon listing is a black sneaker with a black Nike logo. However the sneakers that arrive are a black sneaker with a silver/white Nike logo. It’s not a big deal because the sneaker is a good quality sneaker but just figured I should point it out in case someone is particularly picky on the colors and someone wanting the exact product on the listings image. I just took a black sharpie and colored the Nike logo to make it black.,positive
7,They are for my son. He fell 8 feet and so he basically has no heel on that foot. The 2017 Nike Air’s are the only shoe he can wear. It helps keep his back in alignment!!!,positive
8,"A little expensive but I was willing to spend the extra money for quality. They look nice but not even a week after having them one would squeak every step I took.(right shoe) Shorty after that the left shoe got warn away by the plastic on the inside, and it was poking into my ankle. They were really nice when I first got them and I used them like regular shoes. Didn’t get them wet or anything. I barely wore them. Nike makes good products, but not this one. Save your money or buy a different shoe.",negative

12,"Bought these shoes in Feb and by May, the toe had completed peeled  ack and both shoes had the air pockets rupture. I don't run in these. These are just my daily office and walking around shoes. I can't believe the trash Nike would put their mark on. Never again will I buy a pair of these crappy shoes.",positive
13,These are great shoes. They wear well and he says they are super comfy. JUST WAY WAY OVERPRICED.  Does Nike live in the same world we do? Because someone did not tell them about Biden economics. Still...love the tennis shoes!,positive

63,Amazing shoes. Comfortable.  I got them to wear to the gym. Ultra comfy,positive
64,"I bought these shoes directly from NIKE and loved them.  Then I decided I liked these shoes so much that I'll look for them on amazon.  I found what appeared to be the exact same shoe and bought them.  When I received them they looked identical but the fit wasn't exact, the tongue of this shoe was shorter and when I ran with them, they didn't have the same flexibility.  Unfortunately, my schedule didn't allow me to discover this until it was too late to return them.  Replicas are fine, but they should be listed as such and priced accordingly",negative
